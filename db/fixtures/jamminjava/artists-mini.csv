If Paul Westerberg had grown up worshiping Angus Young instead of Alex Chiton, the Replacements might have sounded something like this Atlant band."" - Rolling Stone Magazine</p><p><br />The band was formed in 1985 in Atlanta. Kevn Kinney hooked up with Tim Nielsen, who was in a popular band called the Nightporters with drummer Paul Lenz at the time. The band's name, Drivin' 'N' Cryin', was chosen from one of Kevn's many songs that reflected the two directions of their music.</p><p>Various musicians accompanied the threesome in the early years. They signed with indie label 688 Records in 1986 after becoming one of Atlanta's top club draws. Their first album, Scarred But Smarter, was an instant hit and landed them countless tour dates and later a contract with Island Records. In 1987, Lenz left the band and was replaced by Jeff Sullivan, who was recruited just in time to accompany them for their first major-label release. Sullivan had been the drummer for Mr. Crowes Garden, the band that later became The Black Crowes, prior to joining Drivin' 'N' Cryin'. That same year, the band held its first ""Benefit For The Hopeful,"" a concert to raise money for Atlanta homeless organizations, held annually on Dec. 8, the anniversary of John Lennon's death. Other native Georgian group R.E.M's touring rhythm guitarist Buren Fowler joined the trio at this time as well. He was officially asked to join the band in 1988, after repeated on-stage appearances with the group.</p><p>The band released its first album for Island, Whisper Tames The Lion, produced by Anton Fier, in early 1988. The album peaked at No. 130 on the Billboard 200.College radio success (and some commercial) accumulated with airplay of the songs ""Can't Promise You The World"" (for which the band filmed its first video) and ""Powerhouse"".</p><p>1989 marked the release of some of the band's most memorable songs on the Mystery Road album, such as ""Honeysuckle Blue"" and ""Straight To Hell."" In 1991, the more hard-rocking Fly Me Courageous ended up being the band's most commercially successful album, with the album being certified gold. The next few years the band toured with artists such as Neil Young and Soul Asylum. In 1993, the band released another album produced by Geoff Workman, entitled Smoke, which peaked at No. 95 on the Billboard's Top 200 album chart. This album was another all-out rocker, marked with guitar assaults, but it failed to catch on with the public as had its predecessor.</p><p>Kevin Kinney has also maintained a solo career over the years. He released his first solo album, the acoustic MacDougal Blues in 1990. This was followed by Down Out Law in 1994, and The Flower And The Knife in 2000. The latter featured guests such as Blues Traveler's John Popper, Edwin McCain, and members of Gov't Mule and the Allman Brothers Band. He has released three more solo albums since. In addition to his solo recordings, he has frequently performed solo live concerts, including live collaborations with Peter Buck of R.E.M.</p><p>In 2012, Drivin' N' Cryin' signs a distribution deal with Redeye and begins the process of creating and recording material for 4 EPs to be released over a 12 month period.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fdrivin-n-cryin%252Fid348328%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/drivinncryin,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/bIB1tROhIOY"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/qwNX6qTa4pE"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3842,@JamnJavaDoorGal's LOCAL SCENE: The Duskwhales,,http://www.facebook.com/TheDuskwhales,http://www.youtube.com/user/TheDuskwhales,http://theduskwhales.tumblr.com/,17837,"<p>The Duskwhales are a ""gypsy rock"" band from Northern Virginia made up of four hip kids who play good music and eat disgusting amounts of pizza.

For Sixpence None the Richer, it's a reminder of the struggles and uncertainty the band endured over the past few years, before ultimately finding their way again.</p><p>Since forming in 1993, the Nashville-based band (started by Slocum and singer Leigh Nash), has released four albums, scored several hit singles ( ""Kiss Me,"" ""There She Goes,"" ""Don't Dream It's Over"" and ""Breathe Your Name""), appeared on seemingly a million soundtracks, landed a platinum record and even earned a few Grammy nominations. But the band amicably parted ways in 2004, shortly after releasing their last full-length record, Divine Discontent.</p><p>The ""transition"" had begun. After a few outside ventures and solo albums, the band reunited five years ago (with Rob Mitchell and Justin Cary). ""When we parted it didn't take me long to miss the band,"" Nash admits. ""The music Matt and I make together makes me really happy. So it was great to get back together.""</p><p>The group started slowly, releasing an EP and a Christmas album while touring a bit here and there. But putting together a new, original full-length record was never necessarily in the cards. For one, the band had to wade through various label and business issues; fortunately, they were able to find a newfound musical freedom by partnering with the independent music distributor The Orchard. ""I kind of wished we had done this all along,"" admits Nash. ""It gives a lot of independence. I really respect bands like Over the Rhine that release records, tour and find an audience pretty much doing everything on their own.""</p><p>Long in the making, Lost in Transition finds Slocum and Nash sharing the songwriting duties (along with musician Stephen Wilson, Nash's husband). ""It's been great to see Leigh grow as a songwriter-her writing is now on par with her singing, which is saying a lot,"" says Slocum. Transition also features a stripped down sound; the end result is a gorgeous mix of pop hooks, piano, acoustic guitars, a bit of country and a newfound and beautiful simplicity to the songs.</p><p>""We really just wanted to feature the song and the voice, and let things breathe a little more,"" says Slocum. ""We're not mucking it by the throwing the kitchen sink at it and putting in a million instruments because we could."" [One exception: the horn-fueled, undeniably funky album opener ""My Dear Machine,"" which also acts as somewhat of a lyrical left turn. It's one man's ode to his old car.] Both Slocum and Nash credit producer Jim Scott (Wilco, Crowded House) for the ""less is more"" attitude.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fsixpence-none-the-richer%252Fid22683%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/sixpencemusic,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/v45F0YesdZM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/68MKLkNSMN4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3812,Lindsay Fuller,,https://www.facebook.com/goodcountrypeople,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkOKHhskHvA&feature=player_embedded,http://www.lindsayfuller.com/,0,"<p>Her latest record, You, Anniversary, is the result of a woman who has spent the bulk of her life trying to tell a story well. The title track is based on W.S. Merwin's poem, ""For The Anniversary of My Death,"" in which the poet contemplates the fact that he passes the future day of his death each year unaware. Lindsay's song, a duet with Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls, heaves a beautiful portrait of someone awake to her own mortality yet frustrated with death's undermining of what she's built. Lindsay recorded the album live at engineer Ryan Freeland's (Ray LaMontagne, Joe Henry) Los Angeles studio, Stampede Origin, over the course of 3 days with producer Paul Bryan (Aimee Mann, Grant Lee Phillips). Bryan cast a rather special group of players to paint the mood for each song: Jay Bellerose on drums, Chris Bruce on electric guitar, Paul Bryan himself on bass and mellotron and Jebin Bruni on keys. Lindsay plays a raw nerve of an acoustic guitar on every tune but one. Her deep mournful vocal style, which has garnered comparisons to Patti Smith, Gillian Welch, and Nick Cave, sounds as though it comes from a place of necessity and nowhere else. The result is a rowdy yet affecting telling of stories involving all the things that make the beauty and violence of the human experience so damn curious.

After the blistering second track, ""In Cauda Venenum,"" which will spark a hint of familiarity with longtime fans, the band proves themselves capable of standing toe to toe with the likes of a band like Coldplay with the sweeping and emotional ""What It Means to be Alone.""</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-dear-hunter/id191858902?uo=4&partnerId=30,,https://twitter.com/therealTDH,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ztt1svz0hd0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/8Y85f4hcHvc"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3802,The Early November,,http://www.facebook.com/earlynovember,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92gZsuc1uzk&feature=player_embedded,http://theearlynovembermusic.net/,17803,"<p>The Early November is an American rock band from Hammonton, New Jersey.

That fact is underscored by his winning TV's Australia's Got Talent in 2008, and the Australian National Songwriting Competition at the tender age of 13. But with his new album Let Me Introduce You, Robinson has made a daring quantum leap. The gifted young virtuoso has redefined himself as a budding pop-world visionary, deftly walking a tightrope between the instrumental music that's put him in the spotlight and a unique fusion of vocally based rock, blues, jazz, country and R&amp;B that's entirely his own. <br /> <br />Although it seems like Robinson was born with a guitar in his hands, his first instrument was piano. Robinson truly found his calling at age 13 after meeting the Emmanuel brothers, Phil and Tommy, widely considered Australia's two finest guitarists. He was particularly struck by Tommy's dazzling acoustic finger picking technique and turned to the acoustic guitar as his primary instrument. A few years later - after Robinson had already won his first Australian National Songwriting Competition - Emmanuel introduced him to American audiences, taking him on a tour of the States that included an important stay in Nashville, Tennessee, where Robinson currently lives. On that trek he met Frank Rogers, a top Nashville producer who's made smash records with Brad Paisley, Darius Rucker and many others. It was the beginning of a musical partnership that continues on Let Me Introduce You and began with Robinson's second album, 2009's dazzling all-solo-acoustic Time Jumpin', the sequel to his 2007 made-in-Australia debut Birdseed. In 2008 Robinson went home at the invitation of the producers of Australia's Got Talent, handily winning the competition.  <br /> <br />Recently Robinson's been traveling the world with his own trio featuring a drummer and bassist headlining tours across Europe, Japan, North American and Australia, displaying his virtuosity on acoustic and electric guitar and honing many of the songs on stage that appear on Let Me Introduce You.</p>",,,http://twitter.com/joerobinson1,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/jdQI6P2a8nE"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3795,Sonic Nights,,http://www.facebook.com/sonicnightsband,,http://www.sonicnightsband.com/,0,"<p>Sonic Nights is the new project of brothers Tom and Arthur Lohrmann.

Hit Me Back also exudes McDermott's trademark embrace of faith and hope in the face of adversity. Influenced by such musical giants as Bob Dylan and Van Morrison, McDermott exhibited a talent for mature and lyrically dense songwriting that soon caught the eye-and ear-of then-talent scout Brian Koppelman (now a screenwriter, novelist, director, and producer; best known as the co-writer of ""Ocean's Thirteen"" and ""Rounders""), who immediately signed him to Giant Records.  That first album, 620 West Surf, boasted a Billboard Hot 100 charting single, (""A Wall I Must Climb""). For McDermott, a performer and storyteller to the depths of his soul, his connection with fans and his uncanny ability to communicate universal truths through his own personal experiences are helping fade the many of the scars that remain.  The demons aren't gone; he's just found a place for them to dwell in peace.

Referring to the album as ""a tribute to those who serve our country, love, awakening, and just realizations that life is passing by"" by Hodzic, the band's sophomore effort certainly delves deeper into more serious issues than the group's debut release ""Wonderfall,"" which was critically-acclaimed by the press.&nbsp; In fact, hailed by The Washington Post as ""demonstrating ""plenty of versatility -- on guitar, keyboards and other instruments,"" The Sandbox Kings' debut release essentially put them on the Washington DC music map. Now, several years since their first album, the band is ready to ""rock"" once again with a regional tour planned in support of ""Secrets"" and many special engagement performances planned to celebrate the release of their sophomore album.

Though the group formed just over two years ago, this Kansas City, KS quartet has already begun to make an impact in the underground music scene. In November of 2009, the group released their debut EP ""All The Wrong Places,"" produced by Kevin Gates (Nevershoutnever, Romance On A Rocketship, The Ready Set). These six songs, along with facetime on MTV's Teen Cribs, instantly brought attention to the band and allowed them to begin touring nationally. Though the boys were fresh out of high school, their charisma and professionalism on and off stage gained the band respect and a dedicated following, opening opportunities such as a featured performance at the Texas State Fair, an acoustic tour sponsored by Hot Topic, and support performances with acts like Cartel, We Are The In Crowd, the GS Boyz, and Runner Runner. The After Party recently recorded their sophomore EP with producers Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount (All Time Low, Mayday Parade, Cartel) and released it April 4th, 2011. By listening to tracks like ""Can't Stop"" and ""Secret Lover"" it is evident that the group has graduated from playing adolescent pop rock songs into writing Top 40 hits, ready to take over radio and clubs alike. The group is currently supporting Allstar Weekend (Hollywood Records) on their entire US/Canadian Tour and is set to release their third record this summer. These talented pop rockers are poised to make a huge impact in the music scene in the very near future.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fthe-after-party%252Fid286945420%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/theafterparty/,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/tnlOUHNCiqU"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/qXnAAKi8YH0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3751,Bands Against Bullying Benefit Show,,http://www.facebook.com/BandsAgainstBullying2012,,,17291,<p>Bands Against Bullying was formed in January 2012 by Stevie and Teresa two girls with the mission to make a difference.

Alan had played gigs with Beau Sasser for some time, and had a great deal of respect for Beau's masterful proficiency on the organ, and knowledge of the history behind the instrument.</p><p>Alan muses of Alan Evans Trio's beginnings, ""This is when it all started to come together for me. Danny was straight killin' it, playing guitar exactly the way I would. I knew that Danny and Beau together would be scary."" Danny and Beau both consented to a recording session with one another. Alan set up the mastering date, began thinking about a release date, tour, and even began designing the website and logo.</p><p>Passionate and inspired, Alan cranked out Drop Hop in a couple of days. He recorded bass, drums, guitar and then emailed Beau and Danny the tune of the day to learn for the session. ""It was all coming together so well, I could hear the entire album in my head.

Renee first entered the public spotlight with To Write Love On Her Arms, a non-profit organization that aims to present hope for people struggling with addiction, depression, self-injury and thoughts of suicide. In December 2011, TWLOHA was awarded a $1 million grant from Chase at the first-ever American Giving Awards on NBC.

Red carpet &amp; all. We are dressing up &amp; we ask that if you attend, you dress up as well. When you walk down that red carpet, that is YOUR moment to shine. Most people will never get to experience walking a red carpet, and I know none of us have SO we thought that would be nice touch. Once you're inside, take your seat inside the theater. The movie will run for 45 minutes to an hour. Followed by a Q&amp;A about the music industry. We know there's a lot of fans out there who want to be a part of the industry but don't know where to start. Here's your chance to ask anything you want because we have seen it all.

Over the years, he has worked his way from Junkies intern to afternoon drive on 106.7 The Fan DC. Working his interests into several podcasts, Chad's current 2nd radio love is Red Ring of Death Radio, a podcast covering all the ins, outs and current events of the video game universe. Being this talented has afforded Chad friend's in high places. Most notably, Chad had been drafted as the ombudsman of the Main Street Mafia by his friend Nash Dukes.

But staying together is nearly impossible.  The average marriage lasts about six years, and 95% of new businesses  fail within five years. Twenty two years of anything, especially  Jackopierce, an acoustic duo that got its start playing frat-parties in  the late 80's, is hard to believe. Add-in the fact that Jack O'Neill and  Cary Pierce did not speak for nearly five years before reuniting in  2002 makes twenty years a downright miracle.</p><p>But what happened to them over ten years ago?</p><p>In late 1997, after a decade-long run that produced six records (two  for major label A&amp;M), shows with the biggest acts of the day (Dave  Matthews Band, Matchbox 20, Counting Crows, Sheryl Crow, etc), touring  on three continents, in nine countries and 44 states, and nearly 500,000  records sold, Jack O'Neill and Cary Pierce decided to amicably go their  separate ways.</p><p>""I had just had enough,"" recalls Jack. ""I couldn't just take a break -  I needed it to be over. I needed to find myself - outside of being the  guy from Jackopierce."" After a brief stint with his new band, American  Horse, Jack moved to NYC, joined the critically acclaimed Bat Theater  Company and did voiceover work. Cary took a yearlong break from music  and then embarked on his solo career. Eventually, both Jack and Cary  would release solo records, but neither of them would reach a fraction  of the success that they had achieved together. Rumors circulated about a  possible reunion for years. Finally in the summer of 2002, their old  manager, Brady Wood and his brother, Brandt, got together and started  making the idea a reality.</p><p>""The timing could not have been better,"" says Pierce. ""I was in the  middle of a painful divorce, and it seemed as though my life was falling  apart. Brady and I started scheming on the phone about the reunion  while Brandt was working on Jack.""</p><p>Calls were made, a Dallas Venue was booked and the ball was in  motion. To sweeten the deal, Matt Scannell, Sean Hurley, and Ed Toth  from Vertical Horizon (long time friends and touring-mates) volunteered  to be the backing band. It was starting to come together. After almost  five years of not talking, Jack and Cary were about to get on the phone  and discuss making up, making music, and making a lot of Jackopierce  fans very happy. The shows were sold-out weeks in advance - with  hundreds left in the streets with no tickets. Had Jackopierce actually  grown in popularity during their hiatus? Offers started pouring in and  they took their show on the road once again. But this time it was just  like their humble beginnings: no band, no bus, no crew - just two guys  and two guitars - the way it used to be. And it was working. The fan  base was continuing to grow.</p><p>Older and wiser - both are now fathers. Priorities have changed. ""We  both admit that we did not realize or appreciate what we had,"" says  Jack. ""There is a lot more gratitude - for each other and for the gifts  we have to write and play music."" ""We have been blessed with the ability  to strap guitars on our backs, get on a plane, and go play a show  anywhere in the country,"" says Pierce. ""That is the career I always  hoped we would have.""</p><p>Jackopierce released their first album in 12 years, ""Promise of  Summer"" in 08. And have since released two live albums, ""Mile High: Live  from the Soiled Dove in Denver"" and ""Live from Atlanta"" as well as  ""Acoustic Summer."" They continue to play most major cities once a year  and are working on an album to be released in late 2011.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fjackopierce%252Fid132712%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/jackopierce,,3709,Diego's Umbrella (at Montserrat House),,http://www.facebook.com/DiegosUmbrella,http://www.youtube.com/user/diegosumbrella1?feature=watch,http://www.diegosumbrella.com/,16984,"<p>As San Francisco's ambassadors of gypsy rock, Diego's Umbrella captures California's cultural multiplicity with enthusiasm, humor and decadence.</p><p>These urban gringo mariachis have performed more than a thousand live shows, cloaked in elaborate homemade outfits.

Influenced heavily by flamenco, klezmer, and Latin music, Diego's Umbrella has introduced the world to a new kind of popular music, with sounds reminiscent of Gogol Bordello, Flogging Molly and The Clash. Shortly after migrating to Northern California from rural Wisconsin, DU front man Vaughn Lindstrom (acoustic guitar, vocals, lead songwriter) teamed up with California native Tyson Maulhardt (electric guitar, vocals) to create a musical ensemble that they dubbed Diego's Umbrella. The namesake: their friend's arm tattoo.</p><p>Diego's Umbrella debuted in 2001 with its first album, Songs for the Farmers. With the addition of Marcus Schmidt (bass), Jason Kleinberg (violin, vocals, accordion), Jake Wood (drums, percussion) and Benjamin Leon (lead vocals, electric guitar, percussion), Diego's Umbrella has been packing venues throughout the Western U.S. and Europe with its heavy-hitting live shows and filling airwaves in the U.S. and Europe with lively tunes.&nbsp; The band released Kung Fu Palace in 2006 and Viva la Juerga in 2007. Within a few months Juerga ranked #129 on the CMJ Top 200 Chart. This spring Diego's Umbrella will release the much-anticipated record, Double Panther. Several DU songs were also featured in the X-Dance-award-winning documentary Sofia, the Quiksilver/Roxy surf DVD Shimmer, as well as CBS' Elimination Station. Diego's Umbrella also performs three songs in the Lionsgate comedy Still Waiting (2009).</p><p>""With guitars straight out of a Tarantino movie, the group seamlessly blends mariachi, gypsy, flamenco and ska into one beer-soaked fiesta, with song topics varying from heartache to revolution."" -NewsReview.com</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fdiegos-umbrella%252Fid254446138%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/#!/diegosumbrella,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/HdX0-e4BrsA"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/6bzs7NZCvCg"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3707,The Atlantic Light,,http://www.facebook.com/TheAtlanticLight,http://www.youtube.com/user/theatlanticlight/videos,http://theatlanticlight.com/,16954,"<p>The Atlantic Light was created in December 2011 with the line up consisting of former members of various local Maryland bands.

Like a phoenix born from the ashes, Heather Mae  began anew. Soon after she released a home-recorded EP titled ""Gonna Be  Alright"", and began performing all over NYC and DC (her hometown city).

Lexie's journey started when she got her first guitar at age thirteen, and with that guitar came a passion to perform and write songs, which would later start her music career. Her first YouTube video was posted when she was fourteen and was filmed at Jammin Java, after being invited up on stage by a local band that had been playing. Five years later she has 94 YouTube videos and two million upload views to her account. She has been named one of the ""best singers on YouTube"" through many fan videos, creating a fan base from all over the world. But making videos wasn't enough for her and in the summer of 2010, Lexie found herself in a recording studio for the first time. She created her first Demo CD called ""Feels Like Home,"" showing the music world that underneath the city girl was a country heart. Each song is unlike the other, a different story written in each song. Lexie's biggest hits include her song ""Closer,"" and her re-make of ""Take It on the Run"" by Reo Speedwagon, transforming the 80's rock song into a country hit. Also, more recently, this past year Lexie released a new single called ""Countless"" which can be found on iTunes. But besides iTunes and YouTube, the physical copy of her CD can be bought and you can find all her songs on her Pandora station! Without a major label, Lexie has still been able to build a large fan base and has an amazing career ahead of her.

""We really feel like we're developing something special internationally, something completely organic and new."" says bassist Alex Silverman, ""There's an excitement surrounding it that makes you eager to find out where our amazing fans are going to take the band next.""</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fthis-century%252Fid265015969%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/thiscentury,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/rrNIHQaPJIA"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3694,The Apache Relay,,http://www.facebook.com/theapacherelay?ref=ts,http://www.youtube.com/user/apacherelay,http://www.theapacherelay.com/website/,17497,"<p>Capitalizing on the initial success of their debut with relentless touring, The Apache Relay honed their sound and released their sophomore album American Nomad in April 2011, in the US, via indie stalwart Thirty Tigers. Produced by Neilson Hubbard, the collection of modern roots-&shy;rock tracks encompassed the eclectic range of influences the band meshed so well; a tinge of Bad Brains, some Suzuki training, jazz lessons, a lot of Beatles' listening, a knowledge of traditional mountain music, a worship of Phil Spector and the love for the complex but accessible layers of bands like Arcade Fire. Since the release of American Nomad, The Apache Relay, who round out their live show with the addition of drummer Aaron Early, have continued their regiment of non-&shy;stop touring, amassing a fervent fanbase and performing over 100 dates in 2011 alone, including coveted spots opening for Grammy nominated Mumford &amp; Sons, and a breakout performance at Bonnaroo Music Festival.</p><p>""They've got kind of an Arcade Fire meets boys raised on gospel and Bruce Springsteen approach to what they do, and they're called The Apache Relay.

Lauren Mann and the Fairly Odd Folk do just that. From captivating indie folk-pop melodies to an authentic and energetic performance, you'll get drawn in to the music and won't be let go anytime soon. In spring 2009, Lauren completed a four song EP with songs she recorded on her own, as well as some with local Calgary producer Andrew Hamill. A few months later she put out another self recorded EP and continued to sell these at shows. She completed two more cross-Canada tours, one with British Columbia duo Reeves, and the next with Nashville duo Handsome and Gretyl, who, as well as opening for the shows, also played as part of the Fairly Odd Folk. These three Canadian tours, as well as a three-week tour throughout Denmark, all in the first year of doing music full-time, brought Lauren's show count to just over 200. This wasn't the only milestone reached; she also charted to the #1 folk album on Earshot for the month of December 2010, recorded a new album for release in Spring 2012 at The Vanguard Room in Lakeland, Florida with Aaron Marsh (formerly of Copeland), and was invited to play at the Calgary Folk Music Festival in July 2011 alongside such acts as City and Colour, Couer de Pirate, The Hollow Brethern, The Head and the Heart, Deep Dark Woods, and many more. With infectious music and a strong ambition on their side, Lauren Mann and the Fairly Odd Folk prove that they aren't one to be forgotten any time soon.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Flauren-mann-fairly-odd-folk%252Fid405530746%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/laurenmann,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/30r2S3V0464"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3687,Garrison Starr + Maia Sharp,,https://www.facebook.com/garrisonstarrmusic,http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=v55VFoXCncs,http://www.garrisonstarr.com/,0,"<p><strong>GARRISON STARR </strong>- Over the course of 2 decades in the music industry, Garrison Starr has  toured with Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan on Lilith Fair and Mary  Chapin Carpenter who was also a guest vocalist on two of her albums,  Songs From Take-Off to Landing for Virgin Records and the brand new  Amateur.

David Cousins, who leads the group, has been described by the influential All Music Guide as: ""the most talented Dylan influenced songwriter to come out of England"".  Strawbs are often mentioned in the same breath as progressive rock bands like Yes, King Crimson, and the Moody Blues.  It is well documented that Rick Wakeman left Strawbs to join Yes but returned to appear at Strawbs 40th Anniversary Celebration. However, beyond progressive rock, Strawbs have another key component in their in their complex and intricate songs, in that they emerged out of the British Folk movement of the mid-1960s.  The band started life as the Strawberry Hill Boys playing bluegrass, before moving into the mainstream by making the first Strawbs album with Sandy Denny in 1967, a year before she recorded her first album with Fairport Convention. The recording with Sandy attracted the attention of A&amp;M Records in Los Angeles who signed Strawbs as the first British band on the label! Strawbs has a devoted fan base that continues to grow on the strength of albums like Grave New World, Bursting At The Seams, Hero And Heroine, and Ghosts, and classic songs such as Lay Down, A Glimpse Of Heaven, and Benedictus.  Acoustic Strawbs comprise David Cousins, along with lead guitarist Dave Lambert, and the astonishingly versatile Chas Cronk, who together formed the front-line of the classic 1970s line-up of the band.</p>",,,,,3675,A Couple of A-holes takes the MAIN STAGE!,,http://www.facebook.com/events/318761831551673/,,,17353,"<p>Since everyone loves laughing at an a**hole, we're pleased to announce A Couple of A**holes are back!

Their  music is as current as it is classic. Say Chance strives to keep its  musicality organic by preserving the integrity at the heart of  everything it does. Such honesty is seen with the group's self-titled,  self-released acoustic EP, available through most digital retailers  worldwide.

They've supported the likes of Sara  Bareilles, Augustana, Lisa Hannigan, David Ryan Harris, Dashboard  Confessional, The Smithereens, and Eisley.

Forming in the summer of 2009, guitarists Nate Wilkinson and Daniel Calem,  drummer Tony Reiter, and singer Cecelia Jeffery met through the School of Rock and covered a few Boston and Queen songs and started writing original music. Alex Obolensky replaced Jeffery as the singer at the end of the summer, and Grand Revival put on its first show in the Fall of 2009.</p><p>This lineup remained fairly constant until gaining bassist Gilbert Pitcher in 2010. Grand Revival began to play a lot of shows at Jammin Java and other local venues and grew its fan base.</p><p>In the Summer of 2011, Grand Revival released its EP Just as Grand, recorded by John Fee. After this, guitarist Nate Wilkinson went on tour with the School of Rock All Stars. When returning, Grand Revival had the oppertunity to play at the Gathering of the Vibes festival in Connecticut, but Reiter and Calem were unable to attend; producer John Fee filled in for Reiter and became the permanent drummer while guitarist Richard Smith filled in for Calem. <br /> <br />The same summer, Grand Revival made it into the top 40 of the Battle to Break out, then the Top 9, then after a Battle of the Bands at Jammin Java, the band made it into the Top 3. The band was then disqualified because they were too young. The band that Grand Revival had defeated at Jammin Java won the contest and went on to open the WHFS HFStival at Merriwether Post Pavillion. Guitarist Daniel Calem left the band at the end of the Summer.</p><p>In the Fall of 2011, Grand Revival released the single Someday. The band remained constant and played about five shows per month. In May 2012, Grand Revival played its last show with singer Alex Obolensky, leaving to go to college. Long time friend Kyle Moriarity (age 20) joined Nate Wilkinson (age 17), John Fee ( age 16), and Gilbert Pitcher (age 18) and played his first official show with Grand Revival at Marshall High School, which Wilkinson attends. <br /> <br />In the Summer of 2012, Grand Revival recorded their first full length album, Grand Revival.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,3668,Dub Campaign,,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dub-Campaign/354030937972497,,http://dubcampaign.com/,17531,"<p>The Dub Campaign.. a musical movement, a battle against Babylon...

While she writes intimate, down-to-earth lyrics, they're delivered with a larger-than-life, crystalline voice. Eight years ago she landed the lead role on Instant Star, a hit Canadian TV show which gave her a platform for her music. Alexz and her brother Brendan wrote the celebrated pop songs that her character, Jude Harrison, sang on the show. ""I'm so grateful for my time on the show,"" says Johnson who still acts and enjoys it, ""and for giving me this loyal audience,"" she says. ""They've kept me going at times. At this point I know in my bones that there is an audience for what I do.""</p><p>When Instant Star wrapped after four seasons, Alexz endured her share of off-camera drama in her music career, when both Capitol and Epic, respectively, ended up shelving her records due to internal conflicts .She is best known for her roles as Jude Harrison in the CTV series Instant Star, as Annie Thelan in the Disney Channel series So Weird, and as Erin Ulmer in the 2006 horror film Final Destination 3. She was nominated three times for a Gemini Award for Best Performance in a Children's or Youth Program or Series (Instant Star), winning the award in 2008.</p><p>Today, she's landed in New York City &amp; launched a campaign for a  major tour and funding for her next full-length via Kickstarter. It's  fitting that Alexz would be leading her career in an independent  direction, as her influences have been such free spirited and strong  women themselves. She has cited the haunting nature of Stevie Nicks, the  poetic spirit of Ricky Lee Jones, the style and independence of Diane  Keaton as muses.Her debut album Voodoo was independently released in  2010, followed by the demo release The Basement Recordings in 2011, with  its sequel The Basement Recordings II and EP, Skipping Stone out in  2012, retrospectively.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Falexz-johnson%252Fid59562681%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/alexzjohnson,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/UdTgIm_Ar8s"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Lcy7Xff1nek"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3644,Vinnie Caruana (of I Am The Avalanche & The Movielife),,http://www.facebook.com/iamtheavalanche,http://www.youtube.com/artist/The_Movielife?feature=watch_metadata,http://www.avalancheunited.com/,0,"<p>Vinnie Caruana is was the vocalist for Long Island punk band The Movielife from their inception in 1997 until their break-up in 2003.

Also, he plays lead guitar/vocals for The Sound of Animals Fighting, in which he is known as ""The Walrus."" He produced their most recent album The Ocean and the Sun. In 2008, he released Waxwane, his first solo album, under the name Love You Moon. He is also in other acts such as Coke vs. Bills and Apotheke. Embree has, in the past ten years of his career, established himself as a socially outspoken and musically diverse singer/songwriter/musician. He has contributed to a number of alternative, art, progressive, and psychedelic rock bands and musical groups such as Rx Bandits, The Sound of Animals Fighting, Apotheke, Pebaluna, and Biceratops, among others. Embree has developed a strong following that thrives on experiencing his musically explosive live shows. For Embree, musicianship is paramount. Many of his recordings are done live, including the Rx Bandits albums ...And The Battle Begun and The Resignation; Embree also wrote, produced, and played all the instruments on his debut album, Waxwane, save for a few tracks featuring drums by Chris Tsagakis and vocals by Lauren Coleman (both members of Embree's own homegrown community known as Mash Down Babylon Records). Sense of community is extremely important to Embree, who started MDB Records in 2002. Operated out of a garage referred to as The Elizabethan in Seal Beach, California, MDB releases the music of musicians and artists from Embree's circle of friends. In 2006, Embree began collaborating with management/label Sargent House, who helped MDB release of one of Embree's other band's albums. Love You Moon's debut album Waxwane was released by Sargent House/MDB Digitally on May 20th 2008 with a physical release that August.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Frx-bandits%252Fid13506237%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/rxchoi,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""169"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/edeZz2x8ZwI"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""169"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Z8a1ityx7s4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3640,Gold Motel,,http://www.facebook.com/goldmotelmusic,http://www.youtube.com/user/thisisgoldmotel,http://www.goldmotel.com/,16618,"<p>GOLD MOTEL performed for the first time in December of 2009 with a sold out headlining show in their hometown of Chicago at The Beat Kitchen, coinciding with the release of the Gold Motel EP. In June of 2010, they released their critically acclaimed debut album Summer House, which had SPIN Magazine dubbing them a &ldquo;hot new band,&rdquo; and NYLON Magazine describing their music as &ldquo;[songs] begging to be blasted out of your car&rsquo;s rolled-down windows.&rdquo;<br /><br />GOLD MOTEL quickly followed up Summer House with the Talking Fiction 7&rdquo; in November 2010, which continued to establish GOLD MOTEL&rsquo;s distinct sun-drenched sound.<br />The decidedly West Coast outlook of Summer House and Talking Fiction took GOLD MOTEL on both national and international tours through 2011, playing alongside acts such as fun., Kate Nash, Hellogoodbye, OK Go, Butch Walker, Cold War Kids, They Might Be Giants and more. 2011 also found GOLD MOTEL making debuts at festivals such as Lollapalooza and SXSW. While the band continued to tour and perform through the end of the year, their music was featured on various television shows and commercials. In addition, GOLD MOTEL was featured on a variety of tastemaker radio stations such as KEXP and WXPN, and earned raves from the likes of Nylon, LA Times, SPIN, The New York Post, Alternative Press, Billboard, Refinery29, and Paste among others.<br /><br />After two years of touring and supporting Summer House, GOLD MOTEL began pre-production for their new album in Los Angeles, CA, splitting their time between rehearsals in a house up in the hills of Laurel Canyon and a pool-house in Glendale. Those early pre-production sessions led to the initial material that would make up their self-titled sophomore album, Gold Motel. The band continued pre-production back in Chicago and began preliminary recording in September of 2011 in guitarist Dan Duzsynski&rsquo;s home-studio, DandySounds Studios. Like Summer House and Talking Fiction, Gold Motel was self-produced by the band.<br />In contrast to Summer House, Gold Motel showcases a significant growth and evolution in the band&rsquo;s songwriting and tonality as they continue to explore new musical territory centered on themes of youth, memories, and nostalgia. However, in comparison to their previous releases, Gold Motel still captures the band&rsquo;s renowned pop sensibilities and illustrious West Coast sound.<br /><br />GOLD MOTEL&rsquo;s new self-titled album is due out July 3rd, 2012 on Good as Gold Records/Thirty Tigers with US tour dates</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fgold-motel%252Fid336488787%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/goldmotel,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""169"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/i9xcVC0aeMM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3639,In The Lobby Bar: Lauren Shera + David Ramirez,,http://www.facebook.com/laurenshera,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcx7ehbpKvU&feature=plcp&context=C47b5c43VDvjVQa1PpcFOen1ngoXkN95XPAueVBiDA2q69DJSP5PQ%3D,http://laurenshera.com/,16572,"<p>Music has played an integral part in Lauren Shera's life from the very   beginning.

musical collaboration of singer-songwriters Ashland Miller (guitar/vocals) and Laura Cerulli (drums/vocals). Touring together since 2008 and both veterans of the singer-songwriter circuit, Miller &amp; Cerulli will make you feel like you&rsquo;ve been listening to their music for years. On the heels of their well received 2010 debut recording Unmarked Highway, which was nominated for Best Debut Recording in 2010 by the Washington Area Music Assoc.(WAMA) along with the nomination of Mama&rsquo;s Black Sheep for Best New Artist, comes Drivin&rsquo; On, the second release for Miller &amp; Cerulli. &ldquo;This project is for the fans&rdquo; says Cerulli. &ldquo;We wanted to create something interesting and fun that captures some of the energy from our live performances&rdquo; adds Miller. Drivin&rsquo; On features nine originals and two covers, recorded at some of the duo&rsquo;s favorite venues &amp; festivals during 2011. Drivin&rsquo; On, typical of Mama&rsquo;s Black Sheep, is an effortless blend of Blues, Country and Acoustic Rock. Miller &amp; Cerulli are also joined on several tracks by accomplished Violinist Helen Hausmann, and throughout by Bassist and Recording Engineer Robin Elder. <br /> <br /> Before Mama&rsquo;s Black Sheep, Ashland toured for twelve years as part of the award-winning acoustic duo CommonbonD, releasing six CD's, performing on The Nashville Network (TNN), and showcasing their music in over forty states as well as overseas. Ashland's songwriting, harmonies, and creative musical arrangements have been shared on stage with talent such as John Mayer, Ritchie Havens, Catie Curtis, and Sophie B. Hawkins. Laura previously fronted her own band, Cerulean Groove. Since 2005 she has been touring nationally and internationally as a member of SONiA &amp; disappear fear. Laura&rsquo;s distinctive style has been appreciated everywhere from The Kerrville Folk Festival (TX), to The Barns at Wolftrap (VA), to the High Sierra Music Festival (CA), to The Red Roof Women&rsquo;s Festival (Ontario), and even &lsquo;down under&rsquo; at Woodford Folk Festival (AUS). <br /> <br /> Together Miller and Cerulli create a unique tapestry of songs, weaving vibrant color and rich texture to create a dynamic conversation between guitar and percussion. Miller&rsquo;s passionate voice will make you laugh, cry, feel inspired, and ultimately want more. And Bob Steel of Baltimore Out Loud writes &ldquo;Cerulli opens her mouth and the world stands still as she wrings every drop of emotion out of the lyrics with her powerful, soaring voice, forged in the fire of the blues and tempered in the cool technique of her classical training.""</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For this special show at Jammin&rsquo; Java, they will be joined by bassist Robin Elder, and violinist Helen Hausmann.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fmamas-black-sheep%252Fid367124659%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/#!/MBSBand,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/EuGSmrmq85E"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/iQKdnCoKBpw"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3630,Justin Robinson (Carolina Chocolate Drops),,http://www.facebook.com/justinrobinsonandthemaryannettes,http://www.youtube.com/maryannettes,http://www.jrmas.com/,16817,"<p>Justin Robinson, grammy winner and former member of the Carolina Chocolate Drops, heads a collective of multi-instrumentalists who bring to the stage the magical intersection of their varied musical backgrounds called <a href=""http://justinrobinsonandthemaryannettes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Justin Robinson and the Mary Annettes</a>. Last year, Justin Robinson and the Mary Annettes released an EP called <em>Precious Blood</em>, and they have followed it up this week with the release of their first full-length album, <em>Bones For Tinder</em>. Justin Robinson started studying the violin at age 8, and at a young age  began playing in string quartet with his mom, a cello player and opera  singer. His interest in music was revitalized during college, after which Justin  had a five year stint as a founding member of the Grammy winning <a href=""http://justinrobinsonandthemaryannettes.com/%5C%5Cwww.carolinachocolatedrops.com"" target=""_blank"">Carolina Chocolate Drops</a>. Justin is inspired by everything he's ever heard, and major influences in include rhinestones, the South in the winter, harps, the Apocalypse, doublets, clavichords, robots, and fantasy movies. He also likes sweeping.</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/bones-for-tinder/id482241100,,,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/CMaqofYKBsg"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/_YP1lIEM1s4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3629,Bhi Bhiman,,http://www.facebook.com/bhibhiman,http://www.youtube.com/bhibhiman,http://www.bhiman.com/,16504,"<p>Bhi Bhiman is an American original, and yet he seems transported from an era when songs were more important than the pretty faces that delivered them. His rich, bellowing tenor can soothe or explode at a moment's notice. His lived-in, knowing delivery belies his years. His songwriting, too, is quick to captivate. Bhi's mix of humor and deep empathy puts him in the company of distinguished (and much older) lifelong songsmiths like John Prine, Nick Lowe and Randy Newman. And Bhiman's technical, emotive guitar playing rises to the challenge that his striking voice presents. Through every deviation of style, Bhiman's love of wordplay and that jaw-dropping voice carry the listener through to a new track and a compelling new story. Of course, it helps Bhiman's fine songs to have expert help in crafting his sound. While some of the more minimal tracks on BHIMAN were recorded by the artist on his laptop, the bulk of the disc was tracked at John Vanderslice's famed Tiny Telephone studios by engineer Jay Pellicci and produced by Sam Kassirer (Josh Ritter, Langhorne Slim), who also contributes instrumentation the album. Together, they have created a deep, layered record that is urgent enough to grab listeners at first listen and deep enough to keep them coming back to hear the subtle, soulful shifts in both instrumentation and that powerful human voice. BHIMAN is Bhi's first truly great album, but one gets the impression that he'll be singing his stories for a very long time to come.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fbhi-bhiman%252Fid480694358%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/bhibhiman,"<iframe

spacious acoustic numbers to multi-layered vocals and fresh beats. The honesty of Ben's music is led by what is often described as his tuneful and expressive voice, the kind of voice that makes its impact with the smallest turn of a whispered phrase.</p><p>Ben Taylor's memorable melodies, immaculate acoustic guitar playing and insightful, honest lyrics have been captivating fans since the moment he embarked on this journey ten years ago.

Ben Taylor has previously toured with Sheryl Crow, Blues Traveler and Ziggy Marley among others.</p><p><!--[endif] --></p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fben-taylor%252Fid79036604%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/bentaylorhq,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""169"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ri_7c-ZAHbA"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""169"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/cJYpopw4q3w"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3623,Hank and Cupcakes,,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hank-Cupcakes/58962474478,http://www.youtube.com/user/HankandCupcakes?feature=mhee#p/a/u/0/idVNAuc7fBU,http://hankandcupcakes.com/,16626,"<p>After kicking off 2012 in the most incredible way - by opening a sold-out show for Deadmau5 at NYC's Pier 36, the dynamic twosome is tearing full-speed ahead with the release of their debut album titled NAKED, recorded last summer at the famous Hansa Studios in Berlin (U2, David Bowie, Iggy Pop). ""Liquid Mercury"" the album's first single appeared in Billboard Magazine's Top 40 Indicator Highlights after climbing to the #37 position on the Indicator Charts, making Hank &amp; Cupcakes the highest unsigned band on the chart. The band has also played select dates across Europe and the Middle East so far this year, including playing to a crowds of over 2,000 in Barcelona and 700 in Stockholm and are 'Getting NAKED on the road' as they put it, this summer, with over 30 tour dates across the US. Incessant action and whirlwind touring are nothing new to Hank &amp; Cupcakes, who formed in Tel Aviv just prior to moving to Cuba where they spent six months of musical exploration. The duo ended up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn almost two years ago, drawn by what Cupcakes describes as ""the music, the streets, the energy, the electricity and the nonstop movement of NYC... We feel we can't just sit still here and have the urge to be in constant musical motion."" But if these two feel drawn to NYC, it's clear that the city strongly reciprocates that very sentiment.</p>",,,https://twitter.com/#!/hankandcupcakes,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/WfZA8FWP_BY"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/idVNAuc7fBU"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3621,Teddy Geiger,,http://www.facebook.com/teddygeiger,http://www.youtube.com/user/TeddyGeigerOfficial/videos,http://www.teddygeiger.com/,17261,"<p><strong>Be one of the 10 lucky ticket holders to be selected for an Early Access/Meet &amp; Greet with Teddy Geiger.&nbsp;Purchase advance tickets <a href=""http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2030"" target=""_blank"">online </a>or via phone at 703.255.1566.

While an internet fan buzz fueled his early burgeoning popularity, Teddy's first independent release, the regional EP ""Stepladder"" (on Cred Records), peaked at #1 in Rochester and made the Top 10 in Billboard's mid-Atlantic regional ""Heatseekers"" chart, leading to a deal with Columbia Records.</p><p>Teddy's debut album, ""Underage Thinking,"" was both a popular and critical success.  ""Teddy Geiger projects an easy charm along with his real pop chops,"" raved The New York Times while People magazine, in a three-and-a-half star ""Critic's Choice"" review, predicted that ""Teddy Geiger should have a long career ahead of him.""</p><p>Teddy's dynamic new school pop, informed by the spirit of rock's glory days, earned him spots on shows featuring Gavin DeGraw, Kelly Clarkson, and Hilary Duff's #1 pop tour.  Teddy has shared bills with Brandi Carlile, Pete Yorn, Simple Plan, Fall Out Boy, Frankie J, Jesse McCartney, The Click 5, among others.  Teddy's breakout year closed with the artist becoming the first male to grace the cover of Seventeen magazine in five years.</p><p>Teddy -- who had a dramatic role as an emerging young singer-songwriter in ""Love Monkey,"" the short-lived CBS cult television series (later picked up by VH1) -- made his big screen debut in 2008's ""The Rocker,"" a summer comedy starring Rainn Wilson and Christina Applegate which premiered a number of new Teddy Geiger performances in its soundtrack.</p><p>Since the release of ""The Rocker,"" Teddy Geiger moved to New York City and began writing the songs at the core of The Last Fears. New compositions and performances include ""Shake It Off,"" ""Magic,"" ""Home,"" ""Ordinary Man,"" ""One More Night,"" and ""Walking In The Sun"". The album has a sound not dissimilar from his debut but also showcases both his maturity and depth as a songwriter and craftsman.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fteddy-geiger%252Fid79485230%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/Teddgeiger,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/XlpeDpAmkQM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/J7_ZMIaKUX8"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3619,@JamnJavaDoorGal's LOCAL SCENE: Sub-Radio Standard,,,,,17438,"<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/JamnJavaDoorGal"" target=""_blank"">@JamnJavaDoorGal</a></p>",,,,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/D2BwG8pRFJM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"," <iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/5Vmgp_YSeNE"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3614,The Invisible Children Tour: The Rocketboys,,http://www.facebook.com/therocketboys,http://www.youtube.com/therocketboys,http://www.therocketboys.com/,17913,"<p>On their previous recordings, ""20,000 Ghosts"" and ""Wellwisher,"" The Rocketboys perfectly married themes of unity and brotherhood with rich, soaring rock, lifting the band to national critical acclaim.  The band supported its releases with lengthy tours and multiple festival appearances but inevitably the rigors of the road took their toll, eventually rupturing the band's momentum in the winter of 2010-11. Three members of the sextet of college friends from Abilene, Texas left to focus on other endeavors, and the split nearly ended the band.</p><p>The resulting hiatus did have its upside, allowing front-man Brandon Kinder a window both to release a solo EP (under the name ""The Wealthy West"") and to pen the theme song for The Discovery Channel's new hit show ""Bering Sea Gold.""  However, in the end, the three remaining members (Kinder, keyboardist Justin Wiseman, and bassist Josh Campbell) agreed they weren't at peace letting The Rocketboys cease to exist. The initial hurdles of rebuilding, though difficult and disheartening, began to give way to new-found inspiration. Though the song-writing process drastically changed as a result of the reduced lineup, with less cooks in the kitchen, a more broad, dynamic range of ideas and visions fermented and flourished. The end result and forthcoming album is ""Build Anyway"". Recorded in their home studio and mixed by CJ Eiriksson (U2, Live, Phish), the album chronicles the emotions that surface through the brokenness in abandonment to the search for peace and closure, both personally and musically.</p>",,,http://www.twitter.com/therocketboys,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/SK9CU74Y1bo"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/M8zWaZ-qeJ4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3610,An Evening with Street Corner Symphony,,http://www.facebook.com/StreetCornerSymphony,http://www.youtube.com/user/strasseneckesinfonie/videos,http://streetcornersymphony.org/,16885,"<p>Street Corner Symphony is an a cappella group based out of Nashville, Tennessee.

These southern gents quickly won over Sing-Off judges Ben Folds, Shawn Stockman, and Nicole Scherzinger and an NBC primetime audience after demonstrating their unique laid back, yet dynamic style of a cappella.  The group consists of three brothers; Jeremy Lister, Jonathan Lister, and Richie Lister; along with Adam Chance, John Martin, and Mark McLemore.  Five out of six members were raised the sons of ministers.   Since their success on The Sing-Off, Street Corner Symphony has been making records and performing for audiences across the country and around the world.

In 2008 he signed a publishing deal with Warner Chappell music publishing and with his writing partner Scott Simons wrote songs for a real housewife of Orange County, a Dutch Idol (Lisa Lois - Sony), a Eurovision Song Contest winner (Lena - Universal) and Judy Garland's grandniece (Audra Mae - Sideonedummy). After leaving Warner in 2009 Wright helped develop local DC artist Chelsea Lee and was instrumental in her signing to Atlantic Records. Four of his songs are on Lee's upcoming Atlantic release. In 2010 Wright signed with Pen music publishing and has since placed songs on TV shows Bones (FOX) and One Tree Hill (CW) as well as an upcoming major motion picture called What's Your Number.Todd is also endlessly wrapped up in various side projects including a power-pop-electronic band with ex-Atlantic recording artist Toby Lightman called Girl Named Toby. He also has a trio with Better Than Ezra bassist Tom Drummond and America's Next Top Model winner CariDee English called Broken English. In his 39th year Wright completed a project called 40x40 where he wrote and released a song every week for 40 weeks culminating on his 40th birthday. The project was participated in by many of Todd's musical buds including members of Collective Soul, Better Than Ezra, The New York Dolls and Taylor Swift's band. One of these songs (Lay Down) was re-mixed by internationally loved producers Roger Shah, Ross Lara and Johnny Yono and reached #18 on the Beatport charts. All of the proceeds raised by 40x40 were donated to Juvenile Diabetes research.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Ftodd-wright%252Fid402515994%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/orangepopsongs,,3606,Charlene Kaye,,https://www.facebook.com/Charlenekayemusic,http://www.youtube.com/charlenekayemusic,http://charlenekaye.com/home/,17501,"<p>Born in Hawaii and raised in Hong Kong, Singapore and Arizona, Charlene's love of music started with classical piano training at age five. At 13, she began teaching herself punk songs on her mom's nylon guitar and was further influenced by her sister's love of classic rock bands such as Queen and Led Zeppelin. After graduating from the University of Michigan with a degree in English, she moved to New York City to pursue a career in music. Things have been nonstop for the ambitious songwriter-performer ever since. Her 2011 single ""Dress and Tie""-featuring longtime friend and Glee star Darren Criss-was featured in a promo for NBC's Chuck, was selected as official boarding music for Delta Airlines, and has amassed over 20,400 downloads on iTunes to date. Last November, she opened for internet sensation Team StarKid and played guitar in their backing band on a sold-out national tour. Charlene has shared a bill with Big Boi, Minus the Bear and Holly Miranda, and her music has been featured on mtvU, The Atlantic Magazine online and The Huffington Post. Last summer, she launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds forAnimal Love, setting a goal of $20,000. Enthusiastic fans netted her upwards of $33,000. While her first record, 2008&prime;s Things I Will Need in the Past, primarily employed acoustic guitars, piano and strings in an avant-folk vein, Animal Love has greater emphasis on pop production, with drum samples, synthesizers and electric guitars populating the soundscape.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fcharlene-kaye%252Fid163929428%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/charlenekaye,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/8SXic7a_ZVI"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/PtGx1ZmFK1g"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3598,SOAR Presents ILUVATAR,,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Iluvatar/117765760211,,,16241,"<p>A rare chance to see the progressive rock band Iluvatar performing new material from their upcoming release plus their classics from all 4 of their CDs!! The band has a renewed energy with a new lead vocalist.</p><p>Perhaps no other American band is so adept at the vintage British progressive rock formula as the Baltimore, Maryland based band Iluvatar.  Named after a chacter in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Simarillion, Iluvatar has been thrilling audiences since 1992 with their song based art rock format featuring superb lyrics and excellent musicianship.  Iluvatar are Dennis Mullen (guitar), Jim Rezek (keyboards), Chris Mack (drums), Dean Morekas (bass) and Jeff Sirody (vocals).  We are delighted to bring this finest of American progressive bands to Jammin Java where they will be debuting their newest CD.</p><p>The band is generally compared to the sounds of Rush, Kansas, Genesis, Marillion, etc. but developed their own sound many moons ago.</p><p>Iluvatar began performing live in the Baltimore area in 1992 and quickly acquired a steadily-growing following of devoted fans. Though the primary focus of their live performances was on their original compositions, the band occasionally accented their sets with music from Genesis, Marillion, Pink Floyd, and Styx.</p><p>Iluvatar's self-titled debut CD was released on Kinesis Records in November 1993 and quickly became the label's top-seller. Iluvatar soon began to receive international recognition for their work. Iluvatar re-entered the studio in March 1995 to record ""Children"", their second album for Kinesis . ""Children"" firmly established Iluvatar as one of the premier American bands in the 90's progressive movement. In 1997 the ""Sideshow"" CD, a collection of live tracks, alternate versions, and unreleased material was released. The latest studio CD ""A Story Two Days Wide"" was released in 1999. The band has continued to write and record since then and a new CD is due out soon.</p>",,,,,3594,@JamnJavaDoorGal's LOCAL SCENE: Fallworth,,,,,16759,"<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/jamnjavadoorgal"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/jamnjavadoorgal</a></p><p>SPONSORED BY:</p><p><a href=""http://www.sonicsweets.com/"" target=""_blank""><img height=""75"" src=""http://jamminjava.com/ee-assets/gallery/artists/adult-artists/Sponsoredby.jpg"" title=""Sponsoredby-Sonic Sweets Recording"" width=""200"" /></a></p>",,,,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/iy7Dslj7A6w"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/l8bErijSY_Y"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3591,Guitar Legend Albert Lee,,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Albert-Lee-Offical/351325401559309,http://youtube.com/AlbertLeeOfficial,http://www.albertlee.co.uk/,17514,"<p>Guitar legend ALBERT LEE first came to prominence during a 1964-68 stint in British Blues and R &amp; B stalwarts Chris Farlowe's Thunderbirds. After working in the UK bands for touring country acts such as Bobby Bare and Skeeter Davis, Lee's next full-time berth was two years with the UK answer to the Flying Burrito Brothers and Nitty Gritty Dirt Band-Head , Hands, and Feet. His reputation grew and session work blossomed, including appearances on ""The London Bo Diddley Sessions"" for Chess and Jerry Lee Lewis' ""The London Sessions"". This and other work with U.S. based greats led to a permanent position in the Crickets, and by the time that ended Albert had long since made Southern California his home. There he became friendly with Don Everly, who had also settled in Southern California; they played regularly on a formal and informal basis, with Albert contributing to Don's 1974 solo effort ""Sunset Towers"". The move to California also led to work on sessions for the debut album of Jackson Browne.</p><p>Albert Lee needs no introduction to Country music &amp; Rock fans.  He has worked with some of the world's top artists, from Emmylou Harris to the Everly Borthers, Dolly Parton to Eric Clapton. In November 2002, at Eric's request, Albert appeared at the star-studded Memorial Concert for George Harrison at London's Albert Hall, and was featured alongside Sherly Crow, VInce Gill and Eric Clapton at Eric's 2007 Crossroads guitar festival.</p>",,,http://twitter.com/ALeeOfficial,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/cek5qZ76FZs"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/qowtL6dM8HU"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3589,The Alternate Routes,,http://facebook.com/thealternateroutes,http://www.youtube.com/user/alternateroutes,http://thealternateroutes.com/,16176,"<p>The Alternate Routes' name suits them well. They're a band that&lsquo;s never really fit in - in a good way. Without a definitive genre to reference or an established scene to rally behind them, they've been something of a rogue wave in an ocean of bands. They built a fan base the old fashioned way, by driving around the country in a big, white Ford Econoline van, winning crowds over one-person-at-a-time with solid, catchy songs and an explosive live show. Since their genesis in 2004, co-founders Tim Warren (vocals, acoustic guitar) and Eric Donnelly (lead guitar) have taken their group through the dizzying heights and frustrating lows of the modern music industry, and have learned some valuable lessons along the way.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fthe-alternate-routes%252Fid21156685%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/alternateroutes,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""233"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/9YGKACx3Dz8"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3586,The Dirty Jacks,,http://www.facebook.com/TheDirtyJacks,http://www.youtube.com/TheDirtyJacks,http://www.thedirtyjacks.com/,16170,"<p>The Dirty Jacks are a progressive/alternative rock band from Rockville, MD, USA, that create and deliver a unique sound, which is winning fans throughout the DC Metro area. They have played in venues across the Mid-Atlantic such as Jammin' Java, The Recher Theatre and Ram's Head Live and have been featured on radio programs, including Noise in the Basement on 98 Rock.  Recently, they won the 2012 Washington Auto Show's Battle of the Bands held at the DC Convention Center and were declared Jammin' Java's Mid-Atlantic Band Battle 6 Champions.

He's been described as having ""an acoustic style that's somewhere between the easygoing charm of Arlo Guthrie and the raw energy of Bruce Springsteen"".   Nachmanoff's voice has been likened to an older Rob Thomas (Matchbox 20) and his guitar style to Mark Knopfler or Richard Thompson. He performs acoustic music influenced by a wide variety of styles and topics.</p><p>Nachmanoff's resume is nothing if not wide-ranging. At the age of 10 he played with Libba Cotton (""Freight Train"") at the Washington Monument. He saw Al Stewart (""Year of the Cat"") live for the first time at Royal Albert Hall in London in 1985, and in 2006 came back and performed with him - and continues to, most recently releasing ""Uncorked"" with the folk-rock legend, and frequently performing in the greater D.C. area with him. He's led songwriting workshops for German school children, synagogue groups, a Native American tribe and stroke survivors. He writes custom songs for weddings and other special occasions. As a side player (guitar, piano, bass, accordion and more) he's worked with Stewart on a regular basis as well as many others at hundreds of venues as far ranging as The Bottom Line, The Birchmere, Glastonbury Festival, and the Edmonton Folk Festival.  Oh, and he's got a doctorate in Philosophy. That he earned in his spare time.</p><p>Dave grew up in the 60's and 70's surrounded by the active folk scene of northern Virginia and Washington DC and inspired by Pete Seeger, country rock, early revival folk like the Kingston Trio and later on, 80's new wave. Toss in a bit of Celtic folk-rock a la Fairport Convention and it's clear how he got his rich melodic sound.</p><p>His brand new CD, ""Step Up"" takes his music to a whole new level. It's his first solo release in five years - produced by Ronan Chris Murphy (King Crimson, Steve Morse), also originally from Arlington, Virginia, and features musicians Bob Malone (currently playing keyboards for John Fogerty), Ian Sheridan (former bassist for Jason Mraz) and Victor Bisetti (former drummer for Los Lobos), and vocalists Al Stewart, Rosemary Butler (Jackson Browne and James Taylor), John Wicks of powerpop band The Records, and Liz Bligan.</p><p>Nationwide independent music consortium Just Plain Folks honored Dave with the 2001 Songwriter of the Year award.  In the past few months, he has been recognized in three songwriting contests - the USA Songwriting Competition, the International Acoustic Music Awards, and the Great American Song Contest. Sing Out! Magazine has praised his ""... heartfelt, inspired songwriting ... with a delivery both biting and assured.""</p><p>Joining Dave for his Jammin Java debut will be his brother, Michael Nachmanoff ,and The Overcommitments.</p>",,,http://twitter.com/davenach,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/MUdIr-iyRPM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",
