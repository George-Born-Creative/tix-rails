If Paul Westerberg had grown up worshiping Angus Young instead of Alex Chiton, the Replacements might have sounded something like this Atlant band."" - Rolling Stone Magazine</p><p><br />The band was formed in 1985 in Atlanta. Kevn Kinney hooked up with Tim Nielsen, who was in a popular band called the Nightporters with drummer Paul Lenz at the time. The band's name, Drivin' 'N' Cryin', was chosen from one of Kevn's many songs that reflected the two directions of their music.</p><p>Various musicians accompanied the threesome in the early years. They signed with indie label 688 Records in 1986 after becoming one of Atlanta's top club draws. Their first album, Scarred But Smarter, was an instant hit and landed them countless tour dates and later a contract with Island Records. In 1987, Lenz left the band and was replaced by Jeff Sullivan, who was recruited just in time to accompany them for their first major-label release. Sullivan had been the drummer for Mr. Crowes Garden, the band that later became The Black Crowes, prior to joining Drivin' 'N' Cryin'. That same year, the band held its first ""Benefit For The Hopeful,"" a concert to raise money for Atlanta homeless organizations, held annually on Dec. 8, the anniversary of John Lennon's death. Other native Georgian group R.E.M's touring rhythm guitarist Buren Fowler joined the trio at this time as well. He was officially asked to join the band in 1988, after repeated on-stage appearances with the group.</p><p>The band released its first album for Island, Whisper Tames The Lion, produced by Anton Fier, in early 1988. The album peaked at No. 130 on the Billboard 200.College radio success (and some commercial) accumulated with airplay of the songs ""Can't Promise You The World"" (for which the band filmed its first video) and ""Powerhouse"".</p><p>1989 marked the release of some of the band's most memorable songs on the Mystery Road album, such as ""Honeysuckle Blue"" and ""Straight To Hell."" In 1991, the more hard-rocking Fly Me Courageous ended up being the band's most commercially successful album, with the album being certified gold. The next few years the band toured with artists such as Neil Young and Soul Asylum. In 1993, the band released another album produced by Geoff Workman, entitled Smoke, which peaked at No. 95 on the Billboard's Top 200 album chart. This album was another all-out rocker, marked with guitar assaults, but it failed to catch on with the public as had its predecessor.</p><p>Kevin Kinney has also maintained a solo career over the years. He released his first solo album, the acoustic MacDougal Blues in 1990. This was followed by Down Out Law in 1994, and The Flower And The Knife in 2000. The latter featured guests such as Blues Traveler's John Popper, Edwin McCain, and members of Gov't Mule and the Allman Brothers Band. He has released three more solo albums since. In addition to his solo recordings, he has frequently performed solo live concerts, including live collaborations with Peter Buck of R.E.M.</p><p>In 2012, Drivin' N' Cryin' signs a distribution deal with Redeye and begins the process of creating and recording material for 4 EPs to be released over a 12 month period.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fdrivin-n-cryin%252Fid348328%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/drivinncryin,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/bIB1tROhIOY"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/qwNX6qTa4pE"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3842,@JamnJavaDoorGal's LOCAL SCENE: The Duskwhales,,http://www.facebook.com/TheDuskwhales,http://www.youtube.com/user/TheDuskwhales,http://theduskwhales.tumblr.com/,17837,"<p>The Duskwhales are a ""gypsy rock"" band from Northern Virginia made up of four hip kids who play good music and eat disgusting amounts of pizza.

For Sixpence None the Richer, it's a reminder of the struggles and uncertainty the band endured over the past few years, before ultimately finding their way again.</p><p>Since forming in 1993, the Nashville-based band (started by Slocum and singer Leigh Nash), has released four albums, scored several hit singles ( ""Kiss Me,"" ""There She Goes,"" ""Don't Dream It's Over"" and ""Breathe Your Name""), appeared on seemingly a million soundtracks, landed a platinum record and even earned a few Grammy nominations. But the band amicably parted ways in 2004, shortly after releasing their last full-length record, Divine Discontent.</p><p>The ""transition"" had begun. After a few outside ventures and solo albums, the band reunited five years ago (with Rob Mitchell and Justin Cary). ""When we parted it didn't take me long to miss the band,"" Nash admits. ""The music Matt and I make together makes me really happy. So it was great to get back together.""</p><p>The group started slowly, releasing an EP and a Christmas album while touring a bit here and there. But putting together a new, original full-length record was never necessarily in the cards. For one, the band had to wade through various label and business issues; fortunately, they were able to find a newfound musical freedom by partnering with the independent music distributor The Orchard. ""I kind of wished we had done this all along,"" admits Nash. ""It gives a lot of independence. I really respect bands like Over the Rhine that release records, tour and find an audience pretty much doing everything on their own.""</p><p>Long in the making, Lost in Transition finds Slocum and Nash sharing the songwriting duties (along with musician Stephen Wilson, Nash's husband). ""It's been great to see Leigh grow as a songwriter-her writing is now on par with her singing, which is saying a lot,"" says Slocum. Transition also features a stripped down sound; the end result is a gorgeous mix of pop hooks, piano, acoustic guitars, a bit of country and a newfound and beautiful simplicity to the songs.</p><p>""We really just wanted to feature the song and the voice, and let things breathe a little more,"" says Slocum. ""We're not mucking it by the throwing the kitchen sink at it and putting in a million instruments because we could."" [One exception: the horn-fueled, undeniably funky album opener ""My Dear Machine,"" which also acts as somewhat of a lyrical left turn. It's one man's ode to his old car.] Both Slocum and Nash credit producer Jim Scott (Wilco, Crowded House) for the ""less is more"" attitude.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fsixpence-none-the-richer%252Fid22683%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/sixpencemusic,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/v45F0YesdZM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/68MKLkNSMN4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3812,Lindsay Fuller,,https://www.facebook.com/goodcountrypeople,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkOKHhskHvA&feature=player_embedded,http://www.lindsayfuller.com/,0,"<p>Her latest record, You, Anniversary, is the result of a woman who has spent the bulk of her life trying to tell a story well. The title track is based on W.S. Merwin's poem, ""For The Anniversary of My Death,"" in which the poet contemplates the fact that he passes the future day of his death each year unaware. Lindsay's song, a duet with Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls, heaves a beautiful portrait of someone awake to her own mortality yet frustrated with death's undermining of what she's built. Lindsay recorded the album live at engineer Ryan Freeland's (Ray LaMontagne, Joe Henry) Los Angeles studio, Stampede Origin, over the course of 3 days with producer Paul Bryan (Aimee Mann, Grant Lee Phillips). Bryan cast a rather special group of players to paint the mood for each song: Jay Bellerose on drums, Chris Bruce on electric guitar, Paul Bryan himself on bass and mellotron and Jebin Bruni on keys. Lindsay plays a raw nerve of an acoustic guitar on every tune but one. Her deep mournful vocal style, which has garnered comparisons to Patti Smith, Gillian Welch, and Nick Cave, sounds as though it comes from a place of necessity and nowhere else. The result is a rowdy yet affecting telling of stories involving all the things that make the beauty and violence of the human experience so damn curious.

After the blistering second track, ""In Cauda Venenum,"" which will spark a hint of familiarity with longtime fans, the band proves themselves capable of standing toe to toe with the likes of a band like Coldplay with the sweeping and emotional ""What It Means to be Alone.""</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-dear-hunter/id191858902?uo=4&partnerId=30,,https://twitter.com/therealTDH,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ztt1svz0hd0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/8Y85f4hcHvc"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3802,The Early November,,http://www.facebook.com/earlynovember,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92gZsuc1uzk&feature=player_embedded,http://theearlynovembermusic.net/,17803,"<p>The Early November is an American rock band from Hammonton, New Jersey.

That fact is underscored by his winning TV's Australia's Got Talent in 2008, and the Australian National Songwriting Competition at the tender age of 13. But with his new album Let Me Introduce You, Robinson has made a daring quantum leap. The gifted young virtuoso has redefined himself as a budding pop-world visionary, deftly walking a tightrope between the instrumental music that's put him in the spotlight and a unique fusion of vocally based rock, blues, jazz, country and R&amp;B that's entirely his own. <br /> <br />Although it seems like Robinson was born with a guitar in his hands, his first instrument was piano. Robinson truly found his calling at age 13 after meeting the Emmanuel brothers, Phil and Tommy, widely considered Australia's two finest guitarists. He was particularly struck by Tommy's dazzling acoustic finger picking technique and turned to the acoustic guitar as his primary instrument. A few years later - after Robinson had already won his first Australian National Songwriting Competition - Emmanuel introduced him to American audiences, taking him on a tour of the States that included an important stay in Nashville, Tennessee, where Robinson currently lives. On that trek he met Frank Rogers, a top Nashville producer who's made smash records with Brad Paisley, Darius Rucker and many others. It was the beginning of a musical partnership that continues on Let Me Introduce You and began with Robinson's second album, 2009's dazzling all-solo-acoustic Time Jumpin', the sequel to his 2007 made-in-Australia debut Birdseed. In 2008 Robinson went home at the invitation of the producers of Australia's Got Talent, handily winning the competition.  <br /> <br />Recently Robinson's been traveling the world with his own trio featuring a drummer and bassist headlining tours across Europe, Japan, North American and Australia, displaying his virtuosity on acoustic and electric guitar and honing many of the songs on stage that appear on Let Me Introduce You.</p>",,,http://twitter.com/joerobinson1,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/jdQI6P2a8nE"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3795,Sonic Nights,,http://www.facebook.com/sonicnightsband,,http://www.sonicnightsband.com/,0,"<p>Sonic Nights is the new project of brothers Tom and Arthur Lohrmann.

Hit Me Back also exudes McDermott's trademark embrace of faith and hope in the face of adversity. Influenced by such musical giants as Bob Dylan and Van Morrison, McDermott exhibited a talent for mature and lyrically dense songwriting that soon caught the eye-and ear-of then-talent scout Brian Koppelman (now a screenwriter, novelist, director, and producer; best known as the co-writer of ""Ocean's Thirteen"" and ""Rounders""), who immediately signed him to Giant Records.  That first album, 620 West Surf, boasted a Billboard Hot 100 charting single, (""A Wall I Must Climb""). For McDermott, a performer and storyteller to the depths of his soul, his connection with fans and his uncanny ability to communicate universal truths through his own personal experiences are helping fade the many of the scars that remain.  The demons aren't gone; he's just found a place for them to dwell in peace.

Referring to the album as ""a tribute to those who serve our country, love, awakening, and just realizations that life is passing by"" by Hodzic, the band's sophomore effort certainly delves deeper into more serious issues than the group's debut release ""Wonderfall,"" which was critically-acclaimed by the press.&nbsp; In fact, hailed by The Washington Post as ""demonstrating ""plenty of versatility -- on guitar, keyboards and other instruments,"" The Sandbox Kings' debut release essentially put them on the Washington DC music map. Now, several years since their first album, the band is ready to ""rock"" once again with a regional tour planned in support of ""Secrets"" and many special engagement performances planned to celebrate the release of their sophomore album.

Though the group formed just over two years ago, this Kansas City, KS quartet has already begun to make an impact in the underground music scene. In November of 2009, the group released their debut EP ""All The Wrong Places,"" produced by Kevin Gates (Nevershoutnever, Romance On A Rocketship, The Ready Set). These six songs, along with facetime on MTV's Teen Cribs, instantly brought attention to the band and allowed them to begin touring nationally. Though the boys were fresh out of high school, their charisma and professionalism on and off stage gained the band respect and a dedicated following, opening opportunities such as a featured performance at the Texas State Fair, an acoustic tour sponsored by Hot Topic, and support performances with acts like Cartel, We Are The In Crowd, the GS Boyz, and Runner Runner. The After Party recently recorded their sophomore EP with producers Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount (All Time Low, Mayday Parade, Cartel) and released it April 4th, 2011. By listening to tracks like ""Can't Stop"" and ""Secret Lover"" it is evident that the group has graduated from playing adolescent pop rock songs into writing Top 40 hits, ready to take over radio and clubs alike. The group is currently supporting Allstar Weekend (Hollywood Records) on their entire US/Canadian Tour and is set to release their third record this summer. These talented pop rockers are poised to make a huge impact in the music scene in the very near future.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fthe-after-party%252Fid286945420%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/theafterparty/,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/tnlOUHNCiqU"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/qXnAAKi8YH0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3751,Bands Against Bullying Benefit Show,,http://www.facebook.com/BandsAgainstBullying2012,,,17291,<p>Bands Against Bullying was formed in January 2012 by Stevie and Teresa two girls with the mission to make a difference.

Alan had played gigs with Beau Sasser for some time, and had a great deal of respect for Beau's masterful proficiency on the organ, and knowledge of the history behind the instrument.</p><p>Alan muses of Alan Evans Trio's beginnings, ""This is when it all started to come together for me. Danny was straight killin' it, playing guitar exactly the way I would. I knew that Danny and Beau together would be scary."" Danny and Beau both consented to a recording session with one another. Alan set up the mastering date, began thinking about a release date, tour, and even began designing the website and logo.</p><p>Passionate and inspired, Alan cranked out Drop Hop in a couple of days. He recorded bass, drums, guitar and then emailed Beau and Danny the tune of the day to learn for the session. ""It was all coming together so well, I could hear the entire album in my head.

Renee first entered the public spotlight with To Write Love On Her Arms, a non-profit organization that aims to present hope for people struggling with addiction, depression, self-injury and thoughts of suicide. In December 2011, TWLOHA was awarded a $1 million grant from Chase at the first-ever American Giving Awards on NBC.

Red carpet &amp; all. We are dressing up &amp; we ask that if you attend, you dress up as well. When you walk down that red carpet, that is YOUR moment to shine. Most people will never get to experience walking a red carpet, and I know none of us have SO we thought that would be nice touch. Once you're inside, take your seat inside the theater. The movie will run for 45 minutes to an hour. Followed by a Q&amp;A about the music industry. We know there's a lot of fans out there who want to be a part of the industry but don't know where to start. Here's your chance to ask anything you want because we have seen it all.

Over the years, he has worked his way from Junkies intern to afternoon drive on 106.7 The Fan DC. Working his interests into several podcasts, Chad's current 2nd radio love is Red Ring of Death Radio, a podcast covering all the ins, outs and current events of the video game universe. Being this talented has afforded Chad friend's in high places. Most notably, Chad had been drafted as the ombudsman of the Main Street Mafia by his friend Nash Dukes.

But staying together is nearly impossible.  The average marriage lasts about six years, and 95% of new businesses  fail within five years. Twenty two years of anything, especially  Jackopierce, an acoustic duo that got its start playing frat-parties in  the late 80's, is hard to believe. Add-in the fact that Jack O'Neill and  Cary Pierce did not speak for nearly five years before reuniting in  2002 makes twenty years a downright miracle.</p><p>But what happened to them over ten years ago?</p><p>In late 1997, after a decade-long run that produced six records (two  for major label A&amp;M), shows with the biggest acts of the day (Dave  Matthews Band, Matchbox 20, Counting Crows, Sheryl Crow, etc), touring  on three continents, in nine countries and 44 states, and nearly 500,000  records sold, Jack O'Neill and Cary Pierce decided to amicably go their  separate ways.</p><p>""I had just had enough,"" recalls Jack. ""I couldn't just take a break -  I needed it to be over. I needed to find myself - outside of being the  guy from Jackopierce."" After a brief stint with his new band, American  Horse, Jack moved to NYC, joined the critically acclaimed Bat Theater  Company and did voiceover work. Cary took a yearlong break from music  and then embarked on his solo career. Eventually, both Jack and Cary  would release solo records, but neither of them would reach a fraction  of the success that they had achieved together. Rumors circulated about a  possible reunion for years. Finally in the summer of 2002, their old  manager, Brady Wood and his brother, Brandt, got together and started  making the idea a reality.</p><p>""The timing could not have been better,"" says Pierce. ""I was in the  middle of a painful divorce, and it seemed as though my life was falling  apart. Brady and I started scheming on the phone about the reunion  while Brandt was working on Jack.""</p><p>Calls were made, a Dallas Venue was booked and the ball was in  motion. To sweeten the deal, Matt Scannell, Sean Hurley, and Ed Toth  from Vertical Horizon (long time friends and touring-mates) volunteered  to be the backing band. It was starting to come together. After almost  five years of not talking, Jack and Cary were about to get on the phone  and discuss making up, making music, and making a lot of Jackopierce  fans very happy. The shows were sold-out weeks in advance - with  hundreds left in the streets with no tickets. Had Jackopierce actually  grown in popularity during their hiatus? Offers started pouring in and  they took their show on the road once again. But this time it was just  like their humble beginnings: no band, no bus, no crew - just two guys  and two guitars - the way it used to be. And it was working. The fan  base was continuing to grow.</p><p>Older and wiser - both are now fathers. Priorities have changed. ""We  both admit that we did not realize or appreciate what we had,"" says  Jack. ""There is a lot more gratitude - for each other and for the gifts  we have to write and play music."" ""We have been blessed with the ability  to strap guitars on our backs, get on a plane, and go play a show  anywhere in the country,"" says Pierce. ""That is the career I always  hoped we would have.""</p><p>Jackopierce released their first album in 12 years, ""Promise of  Summer"" in 08. And have since released two live albums, ""Mile High: Live  from the Soiled Dove in Denver"" and ""Live from Atlanta"" as well as  ""Acoustic Summer."" They continue to play most major cities once a year  and are working on an album to be released in late 2011.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fjackopierce%252Fid132712%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/jackopierce,,3709,Diego's Umbrella (at Montserrat House),,http://www.facebook.com/DiegosUmbrella,http://www.youtube.com/user/diegosumbrella1?feature=watch,http://www.diegosumbrella.com/,16984,"<p>As San Francisco's ambassadors of gypsy rock, Diego's Umbrella captures California's cultural multiplicity with enthusiasm, humor and decadence.</p><p>These urban gringo mariachis have performed more than a thousand live shows, cloaked in elaborate homemade outfits.

Influenced heavily by flamenco, klezmer, and Latin music, Diego's Umbrella has introduced the world to a new kind of popular music, with sounds reminiscent of Gogol Bordello, Flogging Molly and The Clash. Shortly after migrating to Northern California from rural Wisconsin, DU front man Vaughn Lindstrom (acoustic guitar, vocals, lead songwriter) teamed up with California native Tyson Maulhardt (electric guitar, vocals) to create a musical ensemble that they dubbed Diego's Umbrella. The namesake: their friend's arm tattoo.</p><p>Diego's Umbrella debuted in 2001 with its first album, Songs for the Farmers. With the addition of Marcus Schmidt (bass), Jason Kleinberg (violin, vocals, accordion), Jake Wood (drums, percussion) and Benjamin Leon (lead vocals, electric guitar, percussion), Diego's Umbrella has been packing venues throughout the Western U.S. and Europe with its heavy-hitting live shows and filling airwaves in the U.S. and Europe with lively tunes.&nbsp; The band released Kung Fu Palace in 2006 and Viva la Juerga in 2007. Within a few months Juerga ranked #129 on the CMJ Top 200 Chart. This spring Diego's Umbrella will release the much-anticipated record, Double Panther. Several DU songs were also featured in the X-Dance-award-winning documentary Sofia, the Quiksilver/Roxy surf DVD Shimmer, as well as CBS' Elimination Station. Diego's Umbrella also performs three songs in the Lionsgate comedy Still Waiting (2009).</p><p>""With guitars straight out of a Tarantino movie, the group seamlessly blends mariachi, gypsy, flamenco and ska into one beer-soaked fiesta, with song topics varying from heartache to revolution."" -NewsReview.com</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fdiegos-umbrella%252Fid254446138%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/#!/diegosumbrella,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/HdX0-e4BrsA"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/6bzs7NZCvCg"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3707,The Atlantic Light,,http://www.facebook.com/TheAtlanticLight,http://www.youtube.com/user/theatlanticlight/videos,http://theatlanticlight.com/,16954,"<p>The Atlantic Light was created in December 2011 with the line up consisting of former members of various local Maryland bands.

Like a phoenix born from the ashes, Heather Mae  began anew. Soon after she released a home-recorded EP titled ""Gonna Be  Alright"", and began performing all over NYC and DC (her hometown city).

Lexie's journey started when she got her first guitar at age thirteen, and with that guitar came a passion to perform and write songs, which would later start her music career. Her first YouTube video was posted when she was fourteen and was filmed at Jammin Java, after being invited up on stage by a local band that had been playing. Five years later she has 94 YouTube videos and two million upload views to her account. She has been named one of the ""best singers on YouTube"" through many fan videos, creating a fan base from all over the world. But making videos wasn't enough for her and in the summer of 2010, Lexie found herself in a recording studio for the first time. She created her first Demo CD called ""Feels Like Home,"" showing the music world that underneath the city girl was a country heart. Each song is unlike the other, a different story written in each song. Lexie's biggest hits include her song ""Closer,"" and her re-make of ""Take It on the Run"" by Reo Speedwagon, transforming the 80's rock song into a country hit. Also, more recently, this past year Lexie released a new single called ""Countless"" which can be found on iTunes. But besides iTunes and YouTube, the physical copy of her CD can be bought and you can find all her songs on her Pandora station! Without a major label, Lexie has still been able to build a large fan base and has an amazing career ahead of her.

""We really feel like we're developing something special internationally, something completely organic and new."" says bassist Alex Silverman, ""There's an excitement surrounding it that makes you eager to find out where our amazing fans are going to take the band next.""</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fthis-century%252Fid265015969%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/thiscentury,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/rrNIHQaPJIA"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3694,The Apache Relay,,http://www.facebook.com/theapacherelay?ref=ts,http://www.youtube.com/user/apacherelay,http://www.theapacherelay.com/website/,17497,"<p>Capitalizing on the initial success of their debut with relentless touring, The Apache Relay honed their sound and released their sophomore album American Nomad in April 2011, in the US, via indie stalwart Thirty Tigers. Produced by Neilson Hubbard, the collection of modern roots-&shy;rock tracks encompassed the eclectic range of influences the band meshed so well; a tinge of Bad Brains, some Suzuki training, jazz lessons, a lot of Beatles' listening, a knowledge of traditional mountain music, a worship of Phil Spector and the love for the complex but accessible layers of bands like Arcade Fire. Since the release of American Nomad, The Apache Relay, who round out their live show with the addition of drummer Aaron Early, have continued their regiment of non-&shy;stop touring, amassing a fervent fanbase and performing over 100 dates in 2011 alone, including coveted spots opening for Grammy nominated Mumford &amp; Sons, and a breakout performance at Bonnaroo Music Festival.</p><p>""They've got kind of an Arcade Fire meets boys raised on gospel and Bruce Springsteen approach to what they do, and they're called The Apache Relay.

Lauren Mann and the Fairly Odd Folk do just that. From captivating indie folk-pop melodies to an authentic and energetic performance, you'll get drawn in to the music and won't be let go anytime soon. In spring 2009, Lauren completed a four song EP with songs she recorded on her own, as well as some with local Calgary producer Andrew Hamill. A few months later she put out another self recorded EP and continued to sell these at shows. She completed two more cross-Canada tours, one with British Columbia duo Reeves, and the next with Nashville duo Handsome and Gretyl, who, as well as opening for the shows, also played as part of the Fairly Odd Folk. These three Canadian tours, as well as a three-week tour throughout Denmark, all in the first year of doing music full-time, brought Lauren's show count to just over 200. This wasn't the only milestone reached; she also charted to the #1 folk album on Earshot for the month of December 2010, recorded a new album for release in Spring 2012 at The Vanguard Room in Lakeland, Florida with Aaron Marsh (formerly of Copeland), and was invited to play at the Calgary Folk Music Festival in July 2011 alongside such acts as City and Colour, Couer de Pirate, The Hollow Brethern, The Head and the Heart, Deep Dark Woods, and many more. With infectious music and a strong ambition on their side, Lauren Mann and the Fairly Odd Folk prove that they aren't one to be forgotten any time soon.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Flauren-mann-fairly-odd-folk%252Fid405530746%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/laurenmann,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/30r2S3V0464"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3687,Garrison Starr + Maia Sharp,,https://www.facebook.com/garrisonstarrmusic,http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=v55VFoXCncs,http://www.garrisonstarr.com/,0,"<p><strong>GARRISON STARR </strong>- Over the course of 2 decades in the music industry, Garrison Starr has  toured with Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan on Lilith Fair and Mary  Chapin Carpenter who was also a guest vocalist on two of her albums,  Songs From Take-Off to Landing for Virgin Records and the brand new  Amateur.

David Cousins, who leads the group, has been described by the influential All Music Guide as: ""the most talented Dylan influenced songwriter to come out of England"".  Strawbs are often mentioned in the same breath as progressive rock bands like Yes, King Crimson, and the Moody Blues.  It is well documented that Rick Wakeman left Strawbs to join Yes but returned to appear at Strawbs 40th Anniversary Celebration. However, beyond progressive rock, Strawbs have another key component in their in their complex and intricate songs, in that they emerged out of the British Folk movement of the mid-1960s.  The band started life as the Strawberry Hill Boys playing bluegrass, before moving into the mainstream by making the first Strawbs album with Sandy Denny in 1967, a year before she recorded her first album with Fairport Convention. The recording with Sandy attracted the attention of A&amp;M Records in Los Angeles who signed Strawbs as the first British band on the label! Strawbs has a devoted fan base that continues to grow on the strength of albums like Grave New World, Bursting At The Seams, Hero And Heroine, and Ghosts, and classic songs such as Lay Down, A Glimpse Of Heaven, and Benedictus.  Acoustic Strawbs comprise David Cousins, along with lead guitarist Dave Lambert, and the astonishingly versatile Chas Cronk, who together formed the front-line of the classic 1970s line-up of the band.</p>",,,,,3675,A Couple of A-holes takes the MAIN STAGE!,,http://www.facebook.com/events/318761831551673/,,,17353,"<p>Since everyone loves laughing at an a**hole, we're pleased to announce A Couple of A**holes are back!

Their  music is as current as it is classic. Say Chance strives to keep its  musicality organic by preserving the integrity at the heart of  everything it does. Such honesty is seen with the group's self-titled,  self-released acoustic EP, available through most digital retailers  worldwide.

They've supported the likes of Sara  Bareilles, Augustana, Lisa Hannigan, David Ryan Harris, Dashboard  Confessional, The Smithereens, and Eisley.

Forming in the summer of 2009, guitarists Nate Wilkinson and Daniel Calem,  drummer Tony Reiter, and singer Cecelia Jeffery met through the School of Rock and covered a few Boston and Queen songs and started writing original music. Alex Obolensky replaced Jeffery as the singer at the end of the summer, and Grand Revival put on its first show in the Fall of 2009.</p><p>This lineup remained fairly constant until gaining bassist Gilbert Pitcher in 2010. Grand Revival began to play a lot of shows at Jammin Java and other local venues and grew its fan base.</p><p>In the Summer of 2011, Grand Revival released its EP Just as Grand, recorded by John Fee. After this, guitarist Nate Wilkinson went on tour with the School of Rock All Stars. When returning, Grand Revival had the oppertunity to play at the Gathering of the Vibes festival in Connecticut, but Reiter and Calem were unable to attend; producer John Fee filled in for Reiter and became the permanent drummer while guitarist Richard Smith filled in for Calem. <br /> <br />The same summer, Grand Revival made it into the top 40 of the Battle to Break out, then the Top 9, then after a Battle of the Bands at Jammin Java, the band made it into the Top 3. The band was then disqualified because they were too young. The band that Grand Revival had defeated at Jammin Java won the contest and went on to open the WHFS HFStival at Merriwether Post Pavillion. Guitarist Daniel Calem left the band at the end of the Summer.</p><p>In the Fall of 2011, Grand Revival released the single Someday. The band remained constant and played about five shows per month. In May 2012, Grand Revival played its last show with singer Alex Obolensky, leaving to go to college. Long time friend Kyle Moriarity (age 20) joined Nate Wilkinson (age 17), John Fee ( age 16), and Gilbert Pitcher (age 18) and played his first official show with Grand Revival at Marshall High School, which Wilkinson attends. <br /> <br />In the Summer of 2012, Grand Revival recorded their first full length album, Grand Revival.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,3668,Dub Campaign,,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dub-Campaign/354030937972497,,http://dubcampaign.com/,17531,"<p>The Dub Campaign.. a musical movement, a battle against Babylon...

While she writes intimate, down-to-earth lyrics, they're delivered with a larger-than-life, crystalline voice. Eight years ago she landed the lead role on Instant Star, a hit Canadian TV show which gave her a platform for her music. Alexz and her brother Brendan wrote the celebrated pop songs that her character, Jude Harrison, sang on the show. ""I'm so grateful for my time on the show,"" says Johnson who still acts and enjoys it, ""and for giving me this loyal audience,"" she says. ""They've kept me going at times. At this point I know in my bones that there is an audience for what I do.""</p><p>When Instant Star wrapped after four seasons, Alexz endured her share of off-camera drama in her music career, when both Capitol and Epic, respectively, ended up shelving her records due to internal conflicts .She is best known for her roles as Jude Harrison in the CTV series Instant Star, as Annie Thelan in the Disney Channel series So Weird, and as Erin Ulmer in the 2006 horror film Final Destination 3. She was nominated three times for a Gemini Award for Best Performance in a Children's or Youth Program or Series (Instant Star), winning the award in 2008.</p><p>Today, she's landed in New York City &amp; launched a campaign for a  major tour and funding for her next full-length via Kickstarter. It's  fitting that Alexz would be leading her career in an independent  direction, as her influences have been such free spirited and strong  women themselves. She has cited the haunting nature of Stevie Nicks, the  poetic spirit of Ricky Lee Jones, the style and independence of Diane  Keaton as muses.Her debut album Voodoo was independently released in  2010, followed by the demo release The Basement Recordings in 2011, with  its sequel The Basement Recordings II and EP, Skipping Stone out in  2012, retrospectively.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Falexz-johnson%252Fid59562681%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/alexzjohnson,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/UdTgIm_Ar8s"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Lcy7Xff1nek"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3644,Vinnie Caruana (of I Am The Avalanche & The Movielife),,http://www.facebook.com/iamtheavalanche,http://www.youtube.com/artist/The_Movielife?feature=watch_metadata,http://www.avalancheunited.com/,0,"<p>Vinnie Caruana is was the vocalist for Long Island punk band The Movielife from their inception in 1997 until their break-up in 2003.

Also, he plays lead guitar/vocals for The Sound of Animals Fighting, in which he is known as ""The Walrus."" He produced their most recent album The Ocean and the Sun. In 2008, he released Waxwane, his first solo album, under the name Love You Moon. He is also in other acts such as Coke vs. Bills and Apotheke. Embree has, in the past ten years of his career, established himself as a socially outspoken and musically diverse singer/songwriter/musician. He has contributed to a number of alternative, art, progressive, and psychedelic rock bands and musical groups such as Rx Bandits, The Sound of Animals Fighting, Apotheke, Pebaluna, and Biceratops, among others. Embree has developed a strong following that thrives on experiencing his musically explosive live shows. For Embree, musicianship is paramount. Many of his recordings are done live, including the Rx Bandits albums ...And The Battle Begun and The Resignation; Embree also wrote, produced, and played all the instruments on his debut album, Waxwane, save for a few tracks featuring drums by Chris Tsagakis and vocals by Lauren Coleman (both members of Embree's own homegrown community known as Mash Down Babylon Records). Sense of community is extremely important to Embree, who started MDB Records in 2002. Operated out of a garage referred to as The Elizabethan in Seal Beach, California, MDB releases the music of musicians and artists from Embree's circle of friends. In 2006, Embree began collaborating with management/label Sargent House, who helped MDB release of one of Embree's other band's albums. Love You Moon's debut album Waxwane was released by Sargent House/MDB Digitally on May 20th 2008 with a physical release that August.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Frx-bandits%252Fid13506237%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/rxchoi,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""169"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/edeZz2x8ZwI"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""169"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Z8a1ityx7s4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3640,Gold Motel,,http://www.facebook.com/goldmotelmusic,http://www.youtube.com/user/thisisgoldmotel,http://www.goldmotel.com/,16618,"<p>GOLD MOTEL performed for the first time in December of 2009 with a sold out headlining show in their hometown of Chicago at The Beat Kitchen, coinciding with the release of the Gold Motel EP. In June of 2010, they released their critically acclaimed debut album Summer House, which had SPIN Magazine dubbing them a &ldquo;hot new band,&rdquo; and NYLON Magazine describing their music as &ldquo;[songs] begging to be blasted out of your car&rsquo;s rolled-down windows.&rdquo;<br /><br />GOLD MOTEL quickly followed up Summer House with the Talking Fiction 7&rdquo; in November 2010, which continued to establish GOLD MOTEL&rsquo;s distinct sun-drenched sound.<br />The decidedly West Coast outlook of Summer House and Talking Fiction took GOLD MOTEL on both national and international tours through 2011, playing alongside acts such as fun., Kate Nash, Hellogoodbye, OK Go, Butch Walker, Cold War Kids, They Might Be Giants and more. 2011 also found GOLD MOTEL making debuts at festivals such as Lollapalooza and SXSW. While the band continued to tour and perform through the end of the year, their music was featured on various television shows and commercials. In addition, GOLD MOTEL was featured on a variety of tastemaker radio stations such as KEXP and WXPN, and earned raves from the likes of Nylon, LA Times, SPIN, The New York Post, Alternative Press, Billboard, Refinery29, and Paste among others.<br /><br />After two years of touring and supporting Summer House, GOLD MOTEL began pre-production for their new album in Los Angeles, CA, splitting their time between rehearsals in a house up in the hills of Laurel Canyon and a pool-house in Glendale. Those early pre-production sessions led to the initial material that would make up their self-titled sophomore album, Gold Motel. The band continued pre-production back in Chicago and began preliminary recording in September of 2011 in guitarist Dan Duzsynski&rsquo;s home-studio, DandySounds Studios. Like Summer House and Talking Fiction, Gold Motel was self-produced by the band.<br />In contrast to Summer House, Gold Motel showcases a significant growth and evolution in the band&rsquo;s songwriting and tonality as they continue to explore new musical territory centered on themes of youth, memories, and nostalgia. However, in comparison to their previous releases, Gold Motel still captures the band&rsquo;s renowned pop sensibilities and illustrious West Coast sound.<br /><br />GOLD MOTEL&rsquo;s new self-titled album is due out July 3rd, 2012 on Good as Gold Records/Thirty Tigers with US tour dates</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fgold-motel%252Fid336488787%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/goldmotel,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""169"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/i9xcVC0aeMM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3639,In The Lobby Bar: Lauren Shera + David Ramirez,,http://www.facebook.com/laurenshera,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcx7ehbpKvU&feature=plcp&context=C47b5c43VDvjVQa1PpcFOen1ngoXkN95XPAueVBiDA2q69DJSP5PQ%3D,http://laurenshera.com/,16572,"<p>Music has played an integral part in Lauren Shera's life from the very   beginning.

musical collaboration of singer-songwriters Ashland Miller (guitar/vocals) and Laura Cerulli (drums/vocals). Touring together since 2008 and both veterans of the singer-songwriter circuit, Miller &amp; Cerulli will make you feel like you&rsquo;ve been listening to their music for years. On the heels of their well received 2010 debut recording Unmarked Highway, which was nominated for Best Debut Recording in 2010 by the Washington Area Music Assoc.(WAMA) along with the nomination of Mama&rsquo;s Black Sheep for Best New Artist, comes Drivin&rsquo; On, the second release for Miller &amp; Cerulli. &ldquo;This project is for the fans&rdquo; says Cerulli. &ldquo;We wanted to create something interesting and fun that captures some of the energy from our live performances&rdquo; adds Miller. Drivin&rsquo; On features nine originals and two covers, recorded at some of the duo&rsquo;s favorite venues &amp; festivals during 2011. Drivin&rsquo; On, typical of Mama&rsquo;s Black Sheep, is an effortless blend of Blues, Country and Acoustic Rock. Miller &amp; Cerulli are also joined on several tracks by accomplished Violinist Helen Hausmann, and throughout by Bassist and Recording Engineer Robin Elder. <br /> <br /> Before Mama&rsquo;s Black Sheep, Ashland toured for twelve years as part of the award-winning acoustic duo CommonbonD, releasing six CD's, performing on The Nashville Network (TNN), and showcasing their music in over forty states as well as overseas. Ashland's songwriting, harmonies, and creative musical arrangements have been shared on stage with talent such as John Mayer, Ritchie Havens, Catie Curtis, and Sophie B. Hawkins. Laura previously fronted her own band, Cerulean Groove. Since 2005 she has been touring nationally and internationally as a member of SONiA &amp; disappear fear. Laura&rsquo;s distinctive style has been appreciated everywhere from The Kerrville Folk Festival (TX), to The Barns at Wolftrap (VA), to the High Sierra Music Festival (CA), to The Red Roof Women&rsquo;s Festival (Ontario), and even &lsquo;down under&rsquo; at Woodford Folk Festival (AUS). <br /> <br /> Together Miller and Cerulli create a unique tapestry of songs, weaving vibrant color and rich texture to create a dynamic conversation between guitar and percussion. Miller&rsquo;s passionate voice will make you laugh, cry, feel inspired, and ultimately want more. And Bob Steel of Baltimore Out Loud writes &ldquo;Cerulli opens her mouth and the world stands still as she wrings every drop of emotion out of the lyrics with her powerful, soaring voice, forged in the fire of the blues and tempered in the cool technique of her classical training.""</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">For this special show at Jammin&rsquo; Java, they will be joined by bassist Robin Elder, and violinist Helen Hausmann.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fmamas-black-sheep%252Fid367124659%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/#!/MBSBand,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/EuGSmrmq85E"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/iQKdnCoKBpw"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3630,Justin Robinson (Carolina Chocolate Drops),,http://www.facebook.com/justinrobinsonandthemaryannettes,http://www.youtube.com/maryannettes,http://www.jrmas.com/,16817,"<p>Justin Robinson, grammy winner and former member of the Carolina Chocolate Drops, heads a collective of multi-instrumentalists who bring to the stage the magical intersection of their varied musical backgrounds called <a href=""http://justinrobinsonandthemaryannettes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Justin Robinson and the Mary Annettes</a>. Last year, Justin Robinson and the Mary Annettes released an EP called <em>Precious Blood</em>, and they have followed it up this week with the release of their first full-length album, <em>Bones For Tinder</em>. Justin Robinson started studying the violin at age 8, and at a young age  began playing in string quartet with his mom, a cello player and opera  singer. His interest in music was revitalized during college, after which Justin  had a five year stint as a founding member of the Grammy winning <a href=""http://justinrobinsonandthemaryannettes.com/%5C%5Cwww.carolinachocolatedrops.com"" target=""_blank"">Carolina Chocolate Drops</a>. Justin is inspired by everything he's ever heard, and major influences in include rhinestones, the South in the winter, harps, the Apocalypse, doublets, clavichords, robots, and fantasy movies. He also likes sweeping.</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/bones-for-tinder/id482241100,,,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/CMaqofYKBsg"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/_YP1lIEM1s4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3629,Bhi Bhiman,,http://www.facebook.com/bhibhiman,http://www.youtube.com/bhibhiman,http://www.bhiman.com/,16504,"<p>Bhi Bhiman is an American original, and yet he seems transported from an era when songs were more important than the pretty faces that delivered them. His rich, bellowing tenor can soothe or explode at a moment's notice. His lived-in, knowing delivery belies his years. His songwriting, too, is quick to captivate. Bhi's mix of humor and deep empathy puts him in the company of distinguished (and much older) lifelong songsmiths like John Prine, Nick Lowe and Randy Newman. And Bhiman's technical, emotive guitar playing rises to the challenge that his striking voice presents. Through every deviation of style, Bhiman's love of wordplay and that jaw-dropping voice carry the listener through to a new track and a compelling new story. Of course, it helps Bhiman's fine songs to have expert help in crafting his sound. While some of the more minimal tracks on BHIMAN were recorded by the artist on his laptop, the bulk of the disc was tracked at John Vanderslice's famed Tiny Telephone studios by engineer Jay Pellicci and produced by Sam Kassirer (Josh Ritter, Langhorne Slim), who also contributes instrumentation the album. Together, they have created a deep, layered record that is urgent enough to grab listeners at first listen and deep enough to keep them coming back to hear the subtle, soulful shifts in both instrumentation and that powerful human voice. BHIMAN is Bhi's first truly great album, but one gets the impression that he'll be singing his stories for a very long time to come.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fbhi-bhiman%252Fid480694358%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/bhibhiman,"<iframe

spacious acoustic numbers to multi-layered vocals and fresh beats. The honesty of Ben's music is led by what is often described as his tuneful and expressive voice, the kind of voice that makes its impact with the smallest turn of a whispered phrase.</p><p>Ben Taylor's memorable melodies, immaculate acoustic guitar playing and insightful, honest lyrics have been captivating fans since the moment he embarked on this journey ten years ago.

Ben Taylor has previously toured with Sheryl Crow, Blues Traveler and Ziggy Marley among others.</p><p><!--[endif] --></p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fben-taylor%252Fid79036604%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/bentaylorhq,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""169"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ri_7c-ZAHbA"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""169"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/cJYpopw4q3w"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3623,Hank and Cupcakes,,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hank-Cupcakes/58962474478,http://www.youtube.com/user/HankandCupcakes?feature=mhee#p/a/u/0/idVNAuc7fBU,http://hankandcupcakes.com/,16626,"<p>After kicking off 2012 in the most incredible way - by opening a sold-out show for Deadmau5 at NYC's Pier 36, the dynamic twosome is tearing full-speed ahead with the release of their debut album titled NAKED, recorded last summer at the famous Hansa Studios in Berlin (U2, David Bowie, Iggy Pop). ""Liquid Mercury"" the album's first single appeared in Billboard Magazine's Top 40 Indicator Highlights after climbing to the #37 position on the Indicator Charts, making Hank &amp; Cupcakes the highest unsigned band on the chart. The band has also played select dates across Europe and the Middle East so far this year, including playing to a crowds of over 2,000 in Barcelona and 700 in Stockholm and are 'Getting NAKED on the road' as they put it, this summer, with over 30 tour dates across the US. Incessant action and whirlwind touring are nothing new to Hank &amp; Cupcakes, who formed in Tel Aviv just prior to moving to Cuba where they spent six months of musical exploration. The duo ended up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn almost two years ago, drawn by what Cupcakes describes as ""the music, the streets, the energy, the electricity and the nonstop movement of NYC... We feel we can't just sit still here and have the urge to be in constant musical motion."" But if these two feel drawn to NYC, it's clear that the city strongly reciprocates that very sentiment.</p>",,,https://twitter.com/#!/hankandcupcakes,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/WfZA8FWP_BY"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/idVNAuc7fBU"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3621,Teddy Geiger,,http://www.facebook.com/teddygeiger,http://www.youtube.com/user/TeddyGeigerOfficial/videos,http://www.teddygeiger.com/,17261,"<p><strong>Be one of the 10 lucky ticket holders to be selected for an Early Access/Meet &amp; Greet with Teddy Geiger.&nbsp;Purchase advance tickets <a href=""http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2030"" target=""_blank"">online </a>or via phone at 703.255.1566.

While an internet fan buzz fueled his early burgeoning popularity, Teddy's first independent release, the regional EP ""Stepladder"" (on Cred Records), peaked at #1 in Rochester and made the Top 10 in Billboard's mid-Atlantic regional ""Heatseekers"" chart, leading to a deal with Columbia Records.</p><p>Teddy's debut album, ""Underage Thinking,"" was both a popular and critical success.  ""Teddy Geiger projects an easy charm along with his real pop chops,"" raved The New York Times while People magazine, in a three-and-a-half star ""Critic's Choice"" review, predicted that ""Teddy Geiger should have a long career ahead of him.""</p><p>Teddy's dynamic new school pop, informed by the spirit of rock's glory days, earned him spots on shows featuring Gavin DeGraw, Kelly Clarkson, and Hilary Duff's #1 pop tour.  Teddy has shared bills with Brandi Carlile, Pete Yorn, Simple Plan, Fall Out Boy, Frankie J, Jesse McCartney, The Click 5, among others.  Teddy's breakout year closed with the artist becoming the first male to grace the cover of Seventeen magazine in five years.</p><p>Teddy -- who had a dramatic role as an emerging young singer-songwriter in ""Love Monkey,"" the short-lived CBS cult television series (later picked up by VH1) -- made his big screen debut in 2008's ""The Rocker,"" a summer comedy starring Rainn Wilson and Christina Applegate which premiered a number of new Teddy Geiger performances in its soundtrack.</p><p>Since the release of ""The Rocker,"" Teddy Geiger moved to New York City and began writing the songs at the core of The Last Fears. New compositions and performances include ""Shake It Off,"" ""Magic,"" ""Home,"" ""Ordinary Man,"" ""One More Night,"" and ""Walking In The Sun"". The album has a sound not dissimilar from his debut but also showcases both his maturity and depth as a songwriter and craftsman.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fteddy-geiger%252Fid79485230%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/Teddgeiger,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/XlpeDpAmkQM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/J7_ZMIaKUX8"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3619,@JamnJavaDoorGal's LOCAL SCENE: Sub-Radio Standard,,,,,17438,"<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/JamnJavaDoorGal"" target=""_blank"">@JamnJavaDoorGal</a></p>",,,,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/D2BwG8pRFJM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"," <iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/5Vmgp_YSeNE"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3614,The Invisible Children Tour: The Rocketboys,,http://www.facebook.com/therocketboys,http://www.youtube.com/therocketboys,http://www.therocketboys.com/,17913,"<p>On their previous recordings, ""20,000 Ghosts"" and ""Wellwisher,"" The Rocketboys perfectly married themes of unity and brotherhood with rich, soaring rock, lifting the band to national critical acclaim.  The band supported its releases with lengthy tours and multiple festival appearances but inevitably the rigors of the road took their toll, eventually rupturing the band's momentum in the winter of 2010-11. Three members of the sextet of college friends from Abilene, Texas left to focus on other endeavors, and the split nearly ended the band.</p><p>The resulting hiatus did have its upside, allowing front-man Brandon Kinder a window both to release a solo EP (under the name ""The Wealthy West"") and to pen the theme song for The Discovery Channel's new hit show ""Bering Sea Gold.""  However, in the end, the three remaining members (Kinder, keyboardist Justin Wiseman, and bassist Josh Campbell) agreed they weren't at peace letting The Rocketboys cease to exist. The initial hurdles of rebuilding, though difficult and disheartening, began to give way to new-found inspiration. Though the song-writing process drastically changed as a result of the reduced lineup, with less cooks in the kitchen, a more broad, dynamic range of ideas and visions fermented and flourished. The end result and forthcoming album is ""Build Anyway"". Recorded in their home studio and mixed by CJ Eiriksson (U2, Live, Phish), the album chronicles the emotions that surface through the brokenness in abandonment to the search for peace and closure, both personally and musically.</p>",,,http://www.twitter.com/therocketboys,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/SK9CU74Y1bo"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/M8zWaZ-qeJ4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3610,An Evening with Street Corner Symphony,,http://www.facebook.com/StreetCornerSymphony,http://www.youtube.com/user/strasseneckesinfonie/videos,http://streetcornersymphony.org/,16885,"<p>Street Corner Symphony is an a cappella group based out of Nashville, Tennessee.  They became internationally known in 2010 after becoming runners up on Season 2 of NBC's all vocal competition, The Sing-Off.  These southern gents quickly won over Sing-Off judges Ben Folds, Shawn Stockman, and Nicole Scherzinger and an NBC primetime audience after demonstrating their unique laid back, yet dynamic style of a cappella.  The group consists of three brothers; Jeremy Lister, Jonathan Lister, and Richie Lister; along with Adam Chance, John Martin, and Mark McLemore.  Five out of six members were raised the sons of ministers.   Since their success on The Sing-Off, Street Corner Symphony has been making records and performing for audiences across the country and around the world.

From 2004-2006 he was the touring keyboardist for Warner Brothers recording artist Pat McGee whom Wright later co-wrote and produced ""These Days - The Virginia Sessions"" for. In 2008 he signed a publishing deal with Warner Chappell music publishing and with his writing partner Scott Simons wrote songs for a real housewife of Orange County, a Dutch Idol (Lisa Lois - Sony), a Eurovision Song Contest winner (Lena - Universal) and Judy Garland's grandniece (Audra Mae - Sideonedummy). After leaving Warner in 2009 Wright helped develop local DC artist Chelsea Lee and was instrumental in her signing to Atlantic Records. Four of his songs are on Lee's upcoming Atlantic release. In 2010 Wright signed with Pen music publishing and has since placed songs on TV shows Bones (FOX) and One Tree Hill (CW) as well as an upcoming major motion picture called What's Your Number.Todd is also endlessly wrapped up in various side projects including a power-pop-electronic band with ex-Atlantic recording artist Toby Lightman called Girl Named Toby. He also has a trio with Better Than Ezra bassist Tom Drummond and America's Next Top Model winner CariDee English called Broken English. In his 39th year Wright completed a project called 40x40 where he wrote and released a song every week for 40 weeks culminating on his 40th birthday. The project was participated in by many of Todd's musical buds including members of Collective Soul, Better Than Ezra, The New York Dolls and Taylor Swift's band. One of these songs (Lay Down) was re-mixed by internationally loved producers Roger Shah, Ross Lara and Johnny Yono and reached #18 on the Beatport charts. All of the proceeds raised by 40x40 were donated to Juvenile Diabetes research.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Ftodd-wright%252Fid402515994%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/orangepopsongs,,3606,Charlene Kaye,,https://www.facebook.com/Charlenekayemusic,http://www.youtube.com/charlenekayemusic,http://charlenekaye.com/home/,17501,"<p>Born in Hawaii and raised in Hong Kong, Singapore and Arizona, Charlene's love of music started with classical piano training at age five. At 13, she began teaching herself punk songs on her mom's nylon guitar and was further influenced by her sister's love of classic rock bands such as Queen and Led Zeppelin. After graduating from the University of Michigan with a degree in English, she moved to New York City to pursue a career in music. Things have been nonstop for the ambitious songwriter-performer ever since. Her 2011 single ""Dress and Tie""-featuring longtime friend and Glee star Darren Criss-was featured in a promo for NBC's Chuck, was selected as official boarding music for Delta Airlines, and has amassed over 20,400 downloads on iTunes to date. Last November, she opened for internet sensation Team StarKid and played guitar in their backing band on a sold-out national tour. Charlene has shared a bill with Big Boi, Minus the Bear and Holly Miranda, and her music has been featured on mtvU, The Atlantic Magazine online and The Huffington Post. Last summer, she launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds forAnimal Love, setting a goal of $20,000. Enthusiastic fans netted her upwards of $33,000.

The band has a renewed energy with a new lead vocalist.</p><p>Perhaps no other American band is so adept at the vintage British progressive rock formula as the Baltimore, Maryland based band Iluvatar.  Named after a chacter in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Simarillion, Iluvatar has been thrilling audiences since 1992 with their song based art rock format featuring superb lyrics and excellent musicianship.  Iluvatar are Dennis Mullen (guitar), Jim Rezek (keyboards), Chris Mack (drums), Dean Morekas (bass) and Jeff Sirody (vocals).  We are delighted to bring this finest of American progressive bands to Jammin Java where they will be debuting their newest CD.</p><p>The band is generally compared to the sounds of Rush, Kansas, Genesis, Marillion, etc. but developed their own sound many moons ago.</p><p>Iluvatar began performing live in the Baltimore area in 1992 and quickly acquired a steadily-growing following of devoted fans. Though the primary focus of their live performances was on their original compositions, the band occasionally accented their sets with music from Genesis, Marillion, Pink Floyd, and Styx.</p><p>Iluvatar's self-titled debut CD was released on Kinesis Records in November 1993 and quickly became the label's top-seller. Iluvatar soon began to receive international recognition for their work. Iluvatar re-entered the studio in March 1995 to record ""Children"", their second album for Kinesis . ""Children"" firmly established Iluvatar as one of the premier American bands in the 90's progressive movement. In 1997 the ""Sideshow"" CD, a collection of live tracks, alternate versions, and unreleased material was released. The latest studio CD ""A Story Two Days Wide"" was released in 1999. The band has continued to write and record since then and a new CD is due out soon.</p>",,,,,3594,@JamnJavaDoorGal's LOCAL SCENE: Fallworth,,,,,16759,"<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/jamnjavadoorgal"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/jamnjavadoorgal</a></p><p>SPONSORED BY:</p><p><a href=""http://www.sonicsweets.com/"" target=""_blank""><img height=""75"" src=""http://jamminjava.com/ee-assets/gallery/artists/adult-artists/Sponsoredby.jpg"" title=""Sponsoredby-Sonic Sweets Recording"" width=""200"" /></a></p>",,,,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/iy7Dslj7A6w"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/l8bErijSY_Y"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3591,Guitar Legend Albert Lee,,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Albert-Lee-Offical/351325401559309,http://youtube.com/AlbertLeeOfficial,http://www.albertlee.co.uk/,17514,"<p>Guitar legend ALBERT LEE first came to prominence during a 1964-68 stint in British Blues and R &amp; B stalwarts Chris Farlowe's Thunderbirds.

His reputation grew and session work blossomed, including appearances on ""The London Bo Diddley Sessions"" for Chess and Jerry Lee Lewis' ""The London Sessions"". This and other work with U.S. based greats led to a permanent position in the Crickets, and by the time that ended Albert had long since made Southern California his home. There he became friendly with Don Everly, who had also settled in Southern California; they played regularly on a formal and informal basis, with Albert contributing to Don's 1974 solo effort ""Sunset Towers"". The move to California also led to work on sessions for the debut album of Jackson Browne.</p><p>Albert Lee needs no introduction to Country music &amp; Rock fans.  He has worked with some of the world's top artists, from Emmylou Harris to the Everly Borthers, Dolly Parton to Eric Clapton.

He's been described as having ""an acoustic style that's somewhere between the easygoing charm of Arlo Guthrie and the raw energy of Bruce Springsteen"".   Nachmanoff's voice has been likened to an older Rob Thomas (Matchbox 20) and his guitar style to Mark Knopfler or Richard Thompson. He performs acoustic music influenced by a wide variety of styles and topics.</p><p>Nachmanoff's resume is nothing if not wide-ranging. At the age of 10 he played with Libba Cotton (""Freight Train"") at the Washington Monument. He saw Al Stewart (""Year of the Cat"") live for the first time at Royal Albert Hall in London in 1985, and in 2006 came back and performed with him - and continues to, most recently releasing ""Uncorked"" with the folk-rock legend, and frequently performing in the greater D.C. area with him. He's led songwriting workshops for German school children, synagogue groups, a Native American tribe and stroke survivors. He writes custom songs for weddings and other special occasions. As a side player (guitar, piano, bass, accordion and more) he's worked with Stewart on a regular basis as well as many others at hundreds of venues as far ranging as The Bottom Line, The Birchmere, Glastonbury Festival, and the Edmonton Folk Festival.  Oh, and he's got a doctorate in Philosophy. That he earned in his spare time.</p><p>Dave grew up in the 60's and 70's surrounded by the active folk scene of northern Virginia and Washington DC and inspired by Pete Seeger, country rock, early revival folk like the Kingston Trio and later on, 80's new wave. Toss in a bit of Celtic folk-rock a la Fairport Convention and it's clear how he got his rich melodic sound.</p><p>His brand new CD, ""Step Up"" takes his music to a whole new level. It's his first solo release in five years - produced by Ronan Chris Murphy (King Crimson, Steve Morse), also originally from Arlington, Virginia, and features musicians Bob Malone (currently playing keyboards for John Fogerty), Ian Sheridan (former bassist for Jason Mraz) and Victor Bisetti (former drummer for Los Lobos), and vocalists Al Stewart, Rosemary Butler (Jackson Browne and James Taylor), John Wicks of powerpop band The Records, and Liz Bligan.</p><p>Nationwide independent music consortium Just Plain Folks honored Dave with the 2001 Songwriter of the Year award.  In the past few months, he has been recognized in three songwriting contests - the USA Songwriting Competition, the International Acoustic Music Awards, and the Great American Song Contest. Sing Out!

His upbringing at the Maxfield Home orphanage in Kingston and being albino in Jamaica were two obstacles the he overcame and went on to be (at one time) the biggest reggae artist since Bob Marley.&nbsp; His ability to ride rhythm and excite a crowd made Yellow an instant hit in Jamaica. He also began to work with the Ace Sound System in St. Thomas and drew big crowds at his dancehall performances. Later in his career, Yellow began to spread out and work for a number of different producers, sometimes releasing as many as five albums per year. This led to a recording contract with CBS Records. After an extended leave of absence from the record industry, Yellowman began his comeback with the song ""Blueberry Hill"", and his career was re-launched. His first album for RAS came from producer Phillip 'Fatis' Burrell and was called ""Yellow Like Cheese"". Yellowman's witticisms are as cheeky, spirited and intelligent as ever, and delivered with his customary sharp, melodic style. A true reggae legend, Yellowman paved the way for countless dancehall toasters to follow and has had an enormous influence on the world of hip-hop.</span></p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fyellowman%252Fid2531410%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/djyellowman,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""233"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/_4BF7EU0E60"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""233"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/5XQ5W2LElPk"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3562,Adrenaline: Volume 2 featuring Grime Syndicate,,http://www.facebook.com/grimesyndicate,http://www.youtube.com/grimesyndicate,http://www.grime-syndicate.com/,15960,"<p>Grime Syndicate is a bass heavy tag team crew hailing from Washington, DC.

The arrangements are exquisitely produced, and her acoustic songs boast musical textures and colors that embrace the adventurism of jazz."" Stevens' intimate vocals communicate both warmth and effortless urgency, while her exquisitely understated arrangements and seamlessly crafted tunes embrace inventive acoustic textures and idiosyncratic rhythmic and melodic elements.

It was at the New School that she met Chris Tordini and started to put together what would subsequently become the Becca Stevens Band. Since graduating from the New School, Stevens has served as lead singer of Travis Sullivan's Bjorkestra, fronting a genre-bending 18-piece jazz orchestra interpreting the songs of Bj&ouml;rk; toured and recorded with, and written lyrics for, jazz pianist Taylor Eigsti, and most recently performed at Carnegie Hall as featured singer with pianist Brad Mehldau.

Interestingly, it should be noted that acts such as Roseanne Barr and Bruce Springsteen once opened for The Persuasions.

Shortly after listening to the tape, Frank and Gail Zappa signed the group to their label. The Persuasions debut album ""Straight"" was a mix of studio and live recordings released during the fall of 1970. After the Straight album, the Persuasions signed with Capitol Records and have since gone on to release a string of commercially successful and critically acclaimed recordings. The Persuasions have released albums and CD with labels such as MCA, A&amp;M Records, Elektra Records, Flying Fish, Rounder and Rounder/ Bullseye Blues, Music For Little People, (Earthbeat!/Rhino), Grateful Dead Records/ Arista and Chesky Records.</p><p>The sounds of The Persuasions have been featured in films ranging from Joe Versus the Volcano to The Heartbreak Kid and from Streets of Gold to E.T.

Prior to his arrival in the Mid-Atlantic region, the Everything Falls frontman completed his degree in Recording Industry and learned the ropes at two fast-paced Nashville recording studios. It was there in Music City, that he honed his skills as a singer/songwriter.In 2010, Linkous relocated to the DC-MD-VA area where he soon met current bassist, Mike Smith. Together, Smith and Linkous began a diligent search for additional musicians. After multiple rounds of auditions in 2011, the duo gladly welcomed Jeff Sauber on drums and Gabe Goodin on lead guitar. Everything Falls was finally formed. Influenced by (1) the intricate, powerful riffs of such bands as Breaking Benjamin, Chevelle, Three Days Grace and Metallica, and (2) the lyrical sentiments of bands like 3 Doors Down and Theory of a Deadman, Everything Falls delivers a hard-hitting combination of dynamic melodies and gripping lyrics.

With his musical roots planted in Northern California, Lindell's music blossomed in New Orleans. His combination of sweet, blue-eyed soul with foot-stomping R&amp;B, swamp pop, funk and blues won him critical and popular acclaim across the country, with reviews and features in Relix, OffBeat, The Chicago Sun-Times, Harp, Guitar Player, Down Beat, The New Yorker, The New York Press and many other national and regional publications. Singer And Musician magazine put Eric on the cover and many newspaper entertainment sections did the same. The New Orleans Times-Picayune said, ""Eric Lindell has arrived. He channels Van Morrison with his irresistible soul...not a moment is wasted."" The Chicago Sun-Times followed, saying ""Soulful original songs fuse R&amp;B, swamp pop and funk into a potent, party-time mix.""<br /> <br />Lindell's live shows draw as much attention as his material. His unstoppable grooves, rocking, deeply rooted, original songs and excellent musicianship never fail to fill the dance floor.

The band's self-produced debut album, Howl, garnered a massive amount of attention when they released it on their website back in 2008, and now, with Garage Hymns, Empires feels that they have found the sound they've been searching for all along.</p><p>It's been a rapid ascent to critical acclaim for the young Empires, who came together in 2006. Howl was named one of the top five local albums of 2008 by Metromix Chicago, and Empires spent the rest of 2008 and much of 2009 building a profile locally. They sold out several of Chicago most popular music venues, including Schubas, the Beat Kitchen, and the Subterranean. Then, late in 2009, they went back into Max's studio to record again, and in 2010 they released a seven-song EP called BANG.</p><p>To generate more interest in their second collection of self-produced material, the band put out BANG in the form of monthly digital singles until physically releasing a deluxe edition of the album in March of 2010, right before their first SXSW appearance. The BANG EP and their first SXSW appearance ushered in some good national attention. With the BANG EP and a raucous makeout music video for the title track keeping a lot of attention focused on them, Empires quietly began demoing the songs that would later become Garage Hymns in the summer of 2010. Then, from February to May of 2011, the Empires fan base came out in droves once again when Empires was one of sixteen bands being considered for the August cover of Rolling Stone.</p><p>Hand-picked from over 1,200 artists by Rolling Stone editors to be part of the magazine's first ever ""Choose the Cover"" campaign, Empires advanced (through public voting) to one of the final four slots. Rolling Stone called Empires a ""big, multi-faceted, tower of power"" and said that ""inspired by the independent spirit of &lsquo;90s grunge, Empires' music takes the urgency and emotion of that era and reboots it for a new generation.""</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fempires%252Fid266031386%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/weareempires,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""255"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/oE5_maSCGxk"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3530,In The Lobby Bar:  Fight The Lion,,http://www.facebook.com/pages/profile/416649649828,http://www.youtube.com/user/FightTheLionMusic,http://www.fightthelion.com/,16134,"<p>Fight The Lion, one of the top DC-area bands, will be playing a marathon set of mostly your favorite covers and some slammin' originals starting at 10pm and going until last call.

The remarkable new Idiot Heart represents the Philadelphia-based singer/songwriter's finest work thus far, a panoramic collection of exuberant, expansive folk-pop, crafted with uncommon spirit and ingenuity.</p><p>Further inspiration came from such contemporary artists as Patty Griffin, Ani DiFranco, and Joan Osborne, as well as a burgeoning interest in jazz. She began with iconic singers like Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and Nina Simone but soon went down ""the rabbit hole,"" delving into the dazzling sounds of New Orleans via such masters as Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet. In 2005, Carsie recorded and self-released her first CD, Ain't So Green, simply to share her music at shows and open mic nights. She relocated to Philadelphia the following year and was soon drawn into the City of Brotherly Love's thriving caf&eacute; community.</p><p>Carsie began gigging frequently, acquiring a manager and more importantly, a fervent fanbase. She recorded and self-released a second album, 2009's Buoy, this time mixing classic soul and R&amp;B into her own idiosyncratic sound. She also started opening for other like-minded artists, including The Wood Brothers, with whom she formed somewhat of a mutual admiration society. In May 2011, Carsie reached out to the band's Oliver Wood to see if he'd be interested in producing her new record. He agreed and the two began doing pre-production via e-mail, exchanging songs and ideas through the spring. In July, they spent four days at a studio in Wood's native Atlanta, with Wood serving as both producer and guitarist, accompanied by Carsie's longtime bassist Joe Plowman, drummers Jano Rix (The Wood Brothers, Marc Broussard, Damien Marley) and Tyler Greenwell (Susan Tedeschi, Col. Bruce Hampton &amp; The Codetalkers). Additional instrumentation and backing vocals were added in August, including contributions from banjo player Joe McGuinness.</p><p>Carsie has mastered her craft the old-fashioned way, by playing over a hundred shows a year both as headliner and as support to such artists as Joan Osborne, John Oates, David Wilcox, Jimmy Webb, and Loudon Wainwright III. In addition, she's toured Europe, performed on NPR's famed Mountain Stage, and taken part in stage productions of Ana&iuml;s Mitchell's acclaimed Hadestown: A Folk Opera. Blessed with a distinctive voice - both as performer and songwriter - and an unfettered passion for making music, Carsie Blanton is truly something special, a marvelously original artist who is as forthright as she is ambitious.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fcarsie-blanton%252Fid125056352%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/#!/carsieblanton,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/klgEY0SfgN0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3465,Jammin Java's Mid-Atlantic Band Battle 7 - Finals!,,,,,17352,"<p>Jammin Java presents The SEVENTH Mid-Atlantic Band Battle.

Stefanie and Joshua Love and Live music. They have dubbed the term ""folk/Alternative"" to describe their sound style. Joshua and Stefanie grew up in a small town in Northern Virginia. Before pursuing music together as Alleghany St. Joshua and Stefanie each broke ground on their own. Joshua writing music since highschool and perfecting a talent on the guitar, followed his own dream of performing by singing/playing in fashion shows and local talent searches to grow his original soulful voice. Stefanie, singing from before grade school and playing the flute, joined a christian worship team after highschool. Realizing her love for music she grew her unique voice behind a mic in contemporary Chistian music.  After time had passed Stefanie and Joshua decided to to try out for a show called X Factor in New Jersey. The two drove hours away to stand in line and and wait to audtion for major label executives with 20,000 other people for the chance of a life time. They both came away emptied handed but, from that experience the realized they need to be together to purse music as a career. The next week they came up with a couple of their favorite songs and played at a breast cancer fundraiser. They decided that they would be called Alleghany St. since it was the road they grew upon. From then on things grew, and now they are ready for whatever comes their way. Never limited to any certain sound or type of music. Each song and note comes from the heart and the ""real"" factor of life.</p>",,,https://twitter.com/#!/AlleghanySt,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""233"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/PiHNmnsUXI8"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3455,Irresponsible,,http://www.facebook.com/IrresponsibleMusic,,http://www.irresponsiblemusik.com/,0,"<p>Irresponsible is a group of friends and musicians who  are as close to brothers as people from different mothers can get.

Young, old and in-between, they're drawn by songs like ""Ho Hey"" and ""Stubborn Love,"" Americana-inflected barnburners in the vein of the Avett Brothers and Mumford &amp; Sons. They're drawn by songs like ""Slow it Down"" and ""Dead Sea,"" slow, sultry ballads that suggest the raw revelations of Jeff Buckley and Ryan Adams. They're drawn by the live Lumineers experience-a coming-together in musical solidarity against isolation, adversity, and despair. The roots revival of the last few yeas has primed listeners for a new generation of rustic, heart-on-the- sleeve music-the kind that nods to tradition while setting off into uncharted territory. The Lumineers walk that line with an unerring gift for timeless melodies and soul-stirring lyrics. It will all be on display soon, on the band's first full-length album, due in March. Born out of sorrow, powered by passion, ripened by hard work, The Lumineers have found their sound when the world needs it most.</p>",,,,,3451,Gungor- Ghosts Upon the Earth Tour (late show),,http://www.facebook.com/gungormusic,http://www.youtube.com/user/gungormusic,http://www.gungormusic.com/,15526,"<p>Genre titles such as ""Pop"", ""Folk"" and ""Alternative"" are meant to give a listener an idea of what to expect and how to group music together.

And he's bringing himself and all the tunes from this release to his VANCE AT JAMMIN JAVA TENTH ANNIVERSARY SHOW on Saturday April 28.</p><p>Vance has played Jammin Java a mess of times, the first time on April 26th 2002. His musical relationship with Vienna, VA doesn't stop there, however. He has opened for Aretha Franklin twice, and once for Anita Baker at The Barns at Wolftrap...to rave reviews. Ms Baker herself poked her head through the curtain during his opener set in front of her crowd of 4,000+ folks and asked Vance to play another 15 minutes because she was enjoying his work.......................But yeah, for this area, he calls Jammin Java home..</p><p>Speaking of the live show, artists as varied as Arlo Guthrie, Anita Baker, and the late George Carlin have in recent years requested Vance to be added to their evenings.</p><p>Vance Gilbert burst onto the singer/songwriter scene in the early 90's when the buzz spread through the folk clubs of the Northeast about an ex-multicultural arts teacher who was knocking them dead at open mics. Shawn Colvin invited Gilbert to be a special guest on her 1992 Fat City tour. Gilbert took audiences across North America by storm. ""With the voice of an angel, the wit of a devil, and the guitar playing of a god, it was enough to earn him that rarity: an encore for an opener"" wrote the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in its review of a show from that tour. Gilbert's three albums for the Rounder/Philo label are all essential additions to the American singer-songwriter collection. With guests as varied as Tuck and Patti, Jonatha Brooke, Patty Larkin, Vinx, and Jane Siberry, all three albums found significant niches on Non-Commercial radio.</p><p>These discs were followed by the self-released Somerville Live (2000), lionized by the Boston Globe as the disc ""young songwriters should study the way law students cram for bar exams,"" and One Thru Fourteen (2002), a stylistically varied offering that New York's Town and Village called ""lively, eclectic, electrifying and transcending."" Gilbert followed with Side Of The Road (2003), a duo album with Ellis Paul, lauded as ""haunting, artful, and lovely"" by Boston Magazine and nominated for a 2004 Boston Music Award.

From his beginnings as bassist of the legendary Replacements to his current tenure with Guns N' Roses and Soul Asylum, Tommy has always done things his own way and has lived to tell the tale.The story begins with seminal Minneapolis band The Replacements. Tommy started the group with his big brother Bob at the tender age of 13. Only 24 when the band broke up, Tommy set off on his own and formed the Faces-flavored group Bash &amp; Pop. In 1993, Bash &amp; Pop released the album Friday Night Is Killing Me on Warner Bros. His next group, the power-pop quartet Perfect, released a highly acclaimed EP and created a big buzz on the L.A. music scene. It was eventually released in 2004, under the name Once, Twice, Three Times a Maybe.</p><p>Tommy's life took yet another interesting turn in 1998, when Axl Rose asked him to be the new bassist in Guns N' Roses. Since then, he has writing, recording, and touring the world with them. His fingerprints are all over the Chinese Democracy album and his signature presence on stage adds a unique dimension to this notoriously great live band. There are no plans of slowing down in the future for our fearless friend.</p><p>In 2004, Stinson released his first solo album Village Gorilla Head on Sanctuary Records. It was well received by the music press and fans alike. He subsequently toured behind the album backed by his friends The Figgs and Alien Crime Syndicate as his backing bands. In 2005, Tommy was asked to fill in on bass for Soul Asylum (with his high school pal Dave Pirner) after bassist and founding member Karl Mueller succumbed to cancer. The following year he helped finish recording The Silver Lining album with them. He still writes, records, and plays shows with the band whenever he can, and relishes playing with his old friends.</p><p>In August 2011, Tommy will release a new solo effort entitled One Man Mutiny on his own Done To Death Music and as well as continue to tour with Guns N' Roses and Soul Asylum.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,https://twitter.com/#!/tommy_stinson,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/fZ1gQ753Gmg"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3444,Lovedrug,,http://www.facebook.com/lovedrug,http://www.youtube.com/lovedrug,http://www.lovedrugmusic.com/,15527,"<p>Lovedrug first drew national attention with the highly acclaimed Pretend  You're Alive lp in 2004, the fastest selling debut in (then label) The  Militia Group's history.

In November, the band announced the I AM LOVEDRUG  campaign in partnership with PledgeMusic to fund album #4 and, after  reaching their goal over the holiday, Spring 2011 saw the band utilize  producer Paul Moak's Nashville studio to track the entire new album live  to 2"" tape.

Self-produced and titled 'The Heart,' it's a watershed work which sees  Jimmy drop his guard and raise the bar. The prevailing mood is one of  beautiful melancholy, but 'The Heart' has dignity and integrity in  spades. We all have to reckon with loss and the events that have shaped  us sooner or later, and this record is Jimmy Gnecco's compelling attempt  to do just that. Its elegant, elegiac songs are slow-growers that get  right under the skin. It was with shape-shifting alternative rock band  Ours that Jimmy first made a name for himself. A dynamic and urgent  outfit that would later draw comparisons with Radiohead, they soon  caught the attention of various U.S. record companies.<br /><br /> Jimmy signed to DreamWorks records under the Ours moniker in 1997, and  his band's debut album 'Distorted Lullabies' was released in 2001.The  critically acclaimed records 'Precious' and 'Mercy' (the latter handled  by friend, production genius and long-term Jimmy Gnecco fan Rick Rubin)  followed in 2002 and 2008, respectively. Matters beyond Jimmy's control -  major label politics, for example - have sometimes slowed his output,  but he has always retained his positivity, strong work ethic, and a  certain blue-collar mentality, which recognises that respect has to be  earned.<br /><br /> If you've read this far, you will understand why Jimmy Gnecco has been  able to pour so much of himself into his first proper solo record, 'The  Heart.' Out on Bright Antenna records Summer 2010, it's a sterling  achievement; graceful, almost hymnal songs such as ""Mystery"" and ""Take A  Chance"" channel a formidable talent.</p>",,,http://twitter.com/jimmygnecconews,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/KRuXWZiNsb0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/dTNWCLYP0d4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3432,The Fresh Selection's Concert for Action Against Hunger,,,,http://www.actionagainsthunger.org/,15445,"<p>Recognized as a leader in the fight against malnutrition, Action Against Hunger | ACF International saves the lives of malnourished children while providing communities with access to safe water and sustainable solutions to hunger.

Handy Blues Awards. He was nominated for Best New Artist, Best Acoustic Artist, and Best Traditional Blues Artist and his album (BIG MAMA'S DOOR) was nominated for both Acoustic Album of the Year and Traditional Album of the Year. He received the award for Best New Artist. Hart also received two Living Blues Awards that same year. The anticipated sophomore release of TERRITORY in 1998 gave a rousing tribute to all forms of American music and received the Downbeat Magazine Critics' Poll Award for Best Blues Album (though TERRITORY is not a Blues album).</p><p>The summer of 1999 found Hart teaming up with celebrated producer Jim Dickinson to begin recording START WITH THE SOUL, a record hailed as a new-breed Southern Rock classic and one that piloted Hart's return to the ""sacred garage."" START WITH THE SOUL was chosen by the New York Times as one of the top 10 releases of 2000, as well as the BBC's Blues Record of the Year. In 2001 Hart shared Living Blues Magazine's best guitarist honors with fellow road dog Big Jack Johnson. The 2003 release of DOWN IN THE ALLEY garnered a Grammy nomination. Hart continued to diversify his audience by extensively touring as a member of Job Cain, a hard-rocking side project he assembled with guitarist Audley Freed (Cry of Love/Black Crowes) and Nashville musician Robert Kearns (The Bottle Rockets/Lynyrd Skynyrd). In August of 2003, Hart was invited to fill in for Taj Mahal for five nights in Tokyo as a member of Kip Hanrahan's Conjure, the world's longest running jazz poetry ensemble. In 2004, Hart received a Grammy for his philanthropic contribution to the compilation BEAUTIFUL DREAMER: THE SONGS OF STEPHEN FOSTER.</p><p>In 2010 Hart joined forces with friends Luther Dickinson (North Mississippi Allstars, Black Crowes) and Jimbo Mathus (Squirrel Nut Zippers, Tri-State Coalition) to form ""The South Memphis String Band"".

Recorded in a borrowed radio station studio while the band was on its first road trip, their debut record HOME SWEET HOME was received with rabid enthusiasm.

No surprise, then, that she's learned a thing or two about crafting a great story. Starr regularly pinches a sleight of hand or passing sound bite and turns it into a rich character assessment.&nbsp; The Mississippi native struck a major chord on 2002's hallmark Songs From Take-Off to Landing. Breezy tunes like ""Big Sky"", ""At the Heart of This Thing"" and ""Knucklehead"" brought together the independent integrity of Triple-A radio and the polished smile typically aimed at mainstream play. Everything internal-head, heart and hope-worked on a universal scale. The liner notes photo accompanying her acknowledgments spoke volumes: Captured screaming jubilantly, Starr, both hands locked with heavy-metal horns, seems through the clouds. It was a profound high.</p><p>In the years since, Starr has made the road her home and garnered a passionate and loyal following. From her adopted home of Los Angeles to NYC, Nashville to Miami - Starr has crisscrossed the country and continued to entrench herself as a sure fire draw in the indie pop / rock space. Ever the media darling, Starr's focus has never been on their fickle pen, but turned instead to a direct relationship with her fans. Many offer adoration specifically for her consistency, and Starr's genuine, earthy songwriting approach makes it easy to keep rooting-fists clenched and shaking for more artistic evolution.

As he recounts his numerous accomplishments without any bravado, it would be understandable for McLaughlin to feel like he could coast a little as he prepares to release his third album, Promising Promises (Razor &amp; Tie). Case in point: An aptitude for piano discovered as a child, submersion in all school related music programs, college to continue his study of music, cultivating a big online following in the early days of social media, scoring a label deal at age 21, inking big song placements on television and movies, a performance at the Academy Awards, selling 170k albums, debuting at #1 on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart - pretty heady stuff for a guy from Indiana who just wanted to be able to play like Billy Joel someday.</p><p>Jon released his 2007 debut album, Indiana on Island, followed by his sophomore effort, OK Now in 2008.  Both were successful, with Jon sharing the stage with the likes of Kelly Clarkson, Adele, Colbie Caillat, Sara Bareilles, Duffy, One Republic, Johnny Lang, Paolo Nutini, and Matt Wertz among many others. The albums yielded placements on Scrubs and movies like Georgia Rule and Bridge to Terabithia. In the meantime, Jon's manager got a call about an Alan Menken/Stephen Schwartz song for an upcoming Disney film called Enchanted starring Patrick Dempsey and Amy Adams. Immediately interested, Jon flew toLong Island to record the track. A week later, the film's producers asked Jon, by then newly married, if he'd like to perform the song in the film. He and his wife flew back to New York, where he spent a week filming the pivotal ballroom scene in Brooklyn. A year and a half later, the film was released to outstanding reviews and Jon was later asked to perform ""So Close"" at the Academy Awards in 2008.<br /> <br />As Jon began work on his third album, he realized things were changing at his label. ""There were a lot of people there I loved, but it started to not feel like my home anymore. I'd been encouraged to co-write on my first two albums, with half the songs being written with other people. I also had to use musicians the producers had wanted, not my band mates, who I've literally known, and been playing with, since high school and college."" The recording of this album was different: ""I took a long time to write Promising Promises. I knew how I wanted to record these songs, so I got more involved with producing and engineering.""  McLaughlin not only wrote all the songs on the album but he also produced it. He understood this was not the album his major label wanted him to make.  While Jon accepted their decision, he was not going to change the musical course that finally felt so right to him.<br /> <br />The result is his most authentic album yet. Promising Promises reflects Jon's confidence and maturity as a songwriter. Releasing the record on independent label Razor &amp; Tie is also an inspired choice for Jon, who says, ""It's so refreshing to find a group of people who have so much experience in the music business and are still so passionate about music.""<br /> <br />The thirteen piano driven pop tracks include first single ""Summer is Over"" featuring old friend Sara Bareilles, and other stand-out tracks include title track ""Promising Promises,"" ""MaybeIt's Over"" featuring Xenia Martinez, a Season One finalist from The Voice, and ""If Only I,"" a song about unrequited love that is delivered both poignantly and passionately.<br /> <br />Promising Promises, in stores now, is the record Jon's always wanted to make.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fjon-mclaughlin%252Fid214422030%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/jonmclaughlin,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/By7YgbX3GuA"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/sq5izzxdWbg"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"3424,Mike & Ruthy CD Release,,http://www.facebook.com/mikeandruthy?ref=ts,http://www.youtube.com/user/mikeandruthy?feature=fupldc&email=first_upload,http://mikeandruthy.com/,15710,"<p>Mike &amp; Ruthy have been touring and recording together for thirteen years.

Clive was given the opportunity to play at a gig with UK guitar maestro John Renbourn, who, on hearing him play, immediately suggested that Clive record an album. So one year later, Clive was working away in the studio, recording his first album &lsquo;Sixth Sense', which was greeted by press and audiences alike as something of a breath of fresh air in acoustic guitar circles. After years of travelling with guitar giants Renbourn and Emmanuel, it was time to go solo and so in 2006 Clive embarked on a series of tours under his own name, accepting an invitation to appear at the highly-regarded International Guitar Night of America along the way.

The music is emotive, and evokes raw honesty and vulnerability, whilst capturing your attention through its unmistakable power and presence. The Kopeckys followed up SXSW with a mammoth CMJ 2010, where they won over NPR&lsquo;s own Bob Boilen and were invited to play at the official Paste Magazine showcase before becoming the darlings of &lsquo;Store-Cute' and online retailer, Fred Flare.

From Albert Brumley and Woody Guthrie through Leon Russell and Jimmy Webb, Oklahoma has produced songwriters that pursued their singular vision and left the music world enriched, and often changed, by their contributions. Although it would be careless to suggest that an artist just releasing their debut album warrants a place in that group, John Fullbright's From The Ground Up has some of the greats (see above) thinking that the 23-year-old might just have a place in that conversation someday soon.</p><p>Fullbright and Johnson released a live album in 2009 that set sales records at Woodyfest, the annual folk festival honoring Woody Guthrie. Fullbright implores his listener to fight the power and hypocrisy with a wrathful vengeance (""Cut the strings from his fingers/Wrap them twice around his throat/Show him not your kind mercy/From the laws that he forgot he wrote"").</p><p>Fullbright traverses an emotional and musical terrain that is extremely broad, showing equal acuity with tender ballads and songs that make you want to drive faster with your window rolled down. John Fullbright is a young man who finds love, beauty and pain in the here and now, but skepticism and disdain for those that would look past the world or take advantage of the dreams of those hoping for a better world.

His journey spanned three soul-searching summer months during an intense 15-week tour. The result, the band's second full-length album, Wasted. On Wasted the band's familiar sound evolved from past recordings. A huge influence on this was Neil Young, whom Lukas calls a ""distant mentor"" and who suggested the band try a different approach to recording their new album. Helping the band fine tune their sound was Wasted co-producer Jim ""Moose"" Brown, the Grammy Award-winning session musician/songwriter/producer and Bob Seger guitarist.</p><p>The album also pays homage to two of Lukas' favorite musicians, Jimi Hendrix and Neil Young, through creative renditions of a ""Pail Gap"" / ""Hey Baby, ""and ""LA"". There's also a cover of the song ""Peaceful Solution"" co-written by Lukas' father <em>Willie Nelson</em> and sister Amy Niccore. Lukas' dad also offers backing vocals on ""Sound of Your Memory"" and ""Fathers and Mothers."" Lukas' aunt, Bobbie Nelson, plays the piano on ""Fathers and Mothers"" as well.</p><p>The band had a magical time in the studio, taking Nelson's acoustic guitar renditions of the 14 tracks and turning them into true Lukas Nelson &amp; Promise of the Real creations.

His career started years ago, and he still continues to delight fans domestically. John Parr, who is a native of England, first found fame in America with the song he is probably best known for, ""<a href=""http://youtu.be/8d9thIPddFw"" target=""_blank"">St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)</a>,"" the popular 80's tune that he wrote and performed.

In addition, he wrote the song ""Comin' Home"" about his personal journey back to America to play music, reflective of everyone's journey home after being away.</p><p>Throughout his career, Parr has savored a wide range of experiences. Having sold more than 10 million albums, he has worked with a variety of top industry names, including Tina Turner, Bryan Adams, Meatloaf, Journey, Richard Marx, the Beach Boys, Celine Dion among others.

His EP, ""Twenty- Something Blues"" conveys his innate songwriting talent with a tone wistful longing that sounds too deeply steeped in experience to have been written by the twenty-two year old artist. Undoubtedly heart wrenching tunes such as ""You Were Crying,"" will appeal to fans of Mumford and Sons, Ray Lamontagne, and City &amp; Colour. Anderson's music is, however, distinctly American. Flavors of bluegrass, country, and folk music permeate his sound, honed from his past stints playing with Carleigh Nesbit and the Roosevelts.

Passionate, but never preachy. Populist, but definitely not prosaic. New York City singer-songwriter, pianist and beatboxer Rachel Platten is by no means your average headliner-in-the-making. Her Rock Ridge Music debut, Be Here, is a bewitching collection of 10 wise-beyond-their-years piano-driven pop songs that echo elements of Alanis Morissette, Carole King, Tori Amos and Regina Spektor, while retaining a singular sense of self that is rarely found in such a young performer. Be Here was born over the course of an epic trans-Atlantic journey that took the singer-songwriter from London to Los Angeles, on to Stockholm and then back home to New York City. At each stop, she collaborated with top-tier production teams, including Fredrik Thomander (Nsync, Lady Gaga), Jerry Abbott and Grant Black (Robbie Williams, Craig David) and the Wizardz of Oz (Britney Spears, Avril Lavigne). The results are immediately appealing, spirit lifting, heartwarming and mind opening no matter where in the world you are.</p><p>Platten's uplifting, instantly catchy anthems celebrate the love and light in the world with a passionate intensity that has been missing on the radio dial for far too long. Platten enrolled in a songwriting course at the Berklee College of Music before heading to New York City in the fall of 2006. Over the next four years, she wrote the songs that make up Be Here, put together a band and toured at every opportunity, scoring opening slots for The Strokes, Ziggy Marley, Regina Spektor, Tracy Bonham and Rusted Root. Her dynamic live shows earned raves from the Boston Globe, who called her ""breathtaking and brilliant,"" and the New York Post, who declared that she "" blend[ed] sweet delicateness with pluck.""</p><p>This praise is just the beginning for this vibrant singer-songwriter. Be Here is an ecstatic confirmation that pop music can have heart, soul, depth and gravity, while still inspiring you sing along at the top of your lungs.

Throughout the mid-20th century, experience in big bands solidified the prowess of most Jamaican musicians; yet, the genesis for many of the great Skatalites goes back to a boys' school established for the wayward. The Skatalites were formed in June of 1964 and played their first gig on June 27 at the Hi Hat club, on Water Lane in Rae Town. In the late 70's, English two-tone revival groups like The Specials, Madness, The English Beat, and Selector kept the beat alive and well. Then, in the 80's (and ever since), their American counterparts spawned a &lsquo;third wave' and beyond... Groups like The Slackers, HepCat, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, No Doubt, David Hillyard and The Rocksteady 7, The Toasters and King Django, all pay tribute to The Skatalites as a primary influence. This new generation have collectively opened for and played with The Skatalites, raising awareness and maintaining the fan base for a never-ending wave of ska.

He still has that guitar, a Yamaha FG 345. It's been worn and overhauled, first used to figure out the Johnny Cash and John Denver songs his Mom and Dad would play around the house, later being played while writing his own songs in college.</p><p>His songwriting efforts while away at Clarion University outside of Pittsburgh came us much from uncertainty about his future as from any desire to be a musician - ""It was not knowing what the hell I was going to do with myself,"" is the way Forsey describes his motivation to join a cover band in the late 1980s. They played all the popular stuff of the time: John Mellencamp, some blues, 1970s folk and the ""California sound"" of the Eagles. They won some competitions, and Forsey began looking to expand his classic rock vocabulary. He returned to the singer/songwriter accoustic sounds that initially inspired him. Lyrics followed, tentative steps to match words with the chord progressions and pickings in his head and hands.</p><p>After college he recorded some tracks with two friends. The two would relocate to Music Row in Nashville. He gigged sporadically throughout the 1990s, and kept writing and recording songs on a four-track recorder. He had at least 20 finished songs when he met Terry Mettam, a well-known local guitarist, at a Bethesda music store.

His musical output is diverse and considerable---five full length records, numerous side projects including last year's much lauded Sounds of the Americans (4 stars UK Uncut), which was the offshoot of a wildly eclectic score Jim wrote for a theater production of Sam Shepherd's works staged by the legendary Julliard Drama School. Buoyed by the success of helming Where It Hits You, Jim decided to delve further into producing, working on several other artists records in 2010, most notably the debut album of the upstart Belgian Americana outfit Stanton, (featuring G.C Hellings, who Jim describes as ""The best guitar player I ever heard.

We did, and I never slowed down. 7 years, 3 albums, over a half a million records sold on top of countless shows played for thousands and thousands of people around the world including a dozen tours in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, UK, Germany, Belgium, and Chile, my band went as far and as fast as any of us dreamt. We performed on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan O'Brien, and Carson Daly. Over time, lives and minds changed, and something was missing. I was in a band veiled in secrecy and politics. I broke it up and started over.</p><p>I spent the past year and a half writing constantly, churning out the best work of my career. ""These are hit songs. It's your turn. You are a superstar,"" I was told. Just after the New Year, I was inexplicably let go from the label. I took my all of my songs and my vision and hit the ground running. I surrounded myself with a whole new team. It's time to walk the talk.&nbsp; It's all about good, honest music, and lots of it. It's all about fearlessness and new ideas. It's all about playing shows for the best fans in the world and making new ones. It's all about being true to who I am and what I stand for, especially when I don't seem to ""fit in."" I'm not interested in being anyone other than myself.

In 2007 Tony did a solo album titled Stick Man, featuring Pat on drums - and the desire to play that material live spurred a search for a second Stick player. The job was filled admirably by Stickist Michael Bernier, and from 2008 the group wrote and toured extensively, releasing two CD's along the way. In 2010, Michael decided the touring schedule took him away from home more than his family life could handle, so the search began for a replacement. And a short search it was: obvious from the start that Markus Reuter was the right player - he was already in a duo with Pat, called Tuner, and is very knowledgeable about the King Crimson repertoire (much of which Stick Men chooses from in their live shows.) The band has toured in The U.S, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, Italy, France, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Poland, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg, Japan, and the Canary Islands! </span><br /></span></p>",,,,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/efaCy0VDdd8"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3360,Melanie,http://www.myspace.com/melaniesafkamusic,http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1275227621,http://www.youtube.com/user/mellydrome,http://www.melaniesafka.com/home.cfm,16072,"<h5><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><img height=""25"" src=""http://jamminjava.com/ee-assets/gallery/artists/adult-artists/vip_sold_out.jpg"" width=""150"" /></span><span style=""color: #ff0000;""></span></h5><h5><span style=""color: #ffffff;"">(VIP&nbsp; TICKETS: special reserved, front row seat at a table)</span></h5><p>Melanie, who became the voice of an era in one magical instant onstage at Woodstock, has been putting the pieces in order.Pieces of a career, scattered by the winds of experience and assembled again by the force of love into the most personal and brilliant moments of her musical journey.

Her single ""<a href=""http://youtu.be/ZIFknAdVvNM"" target=""_blank"">Brand New Key</a>,"" an infectious romp about freedom and roller skates, topped the charts in 1971. Melanie Safka first attracted national attention when she stepped onto the stage at Woodstock...yes, the real Woodstock. The summer of '69.

With two albums on iTunes, and the hit single ""Back In My Head"" on the way, it is impossible not to expect big things from this band in 2012.</p><p><span style=""color: #c0c0c0;""></span><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Bandits-Beggars/127073824014847"" target=""_blank""></a></p>",,http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitu,https://twitter.com/#!/Thetomlohrmann,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/6Av7aBXjuRM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3335,Girl In A Coma + Chris Merritt And The Dirty Girls,,http://www.facebook.com/girlinacoma,http://www.girlinacoma.com/videos,http://www.girlinacoma.com/,13593,"<p><span style=""color: #ffffff;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p><span style=""color: #ffffff;""><br /></span></p><p><span style=""color: #ffffff;"">7pm - Doors<br />8pm - Chris Merritt &amp; The Dirty Girls<br />9pm - Girl In A Coma</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">Company of Thieves has cancelled their appearance tonight due to health issues.

They've blazed a singular trail since Nina Diaz joined the band at age 13 and have found champions and comrades along the way including Joan Jett who signed them, Morrissey, Sia, Tegan and Sara, The Pogues and Amanda Palmer who have hand selected them for tours. In addition, Robert Rodriguez asked them to compose one of the key songs for his film Machete last year. All the while, they have been building one of the most impassioned and diverse fan bases in music. Girl in a Coma are that rare feral band, unaffected by trends, that has managed to stay wild and thrill us at every turn. Exits &amp; All the Rest, their 4th album out November 1 on Blackheart Records, is the most heart-stopping turn yet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />Raised in the dense Blue Ridge Mountains of Northern Virginia, Chris Merritt is a unique voice that cuts through the clatter with objectively good music from the heart. He cleverly blends the sounds of piano-driven rock, pop, rhythm and blues with personal stories of love-at-first-sight, homesickness and poverty to perceptions of quantum physics, corrupt governments and Karl Pilkington. Chris has written and recorded over 1,000 songs and played hundreds of shows across the U.S., Canada and Japan. Chosen for the ""Top Six"" in Billboard Magazine's Indie World Series and having opened a show for rock legend Ben Folds in the same year, Chris is a stand-out performer.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Chris Merritt And The Dirty Girls</span> <a href=""http://www.chrismerrittmusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/chris_merritt"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/chrismerritt"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/chrismerrittmusic"">facebook </a>| <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya7H8fqf8vA&amp;feature=player_embedded"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fgirl-in-a-coma%252Fid252488650%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/#!/girlinacoma,"<iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/JIL6P2_B3gA"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3334,Company Of Thieves,http://www.myspace.com/companyofthieves,http://www.facebook.com/companyofthieves,http://www.youtube.com/CompanyofThieves,http://www.companyofthieves.net/,15133,"<p>Like all great artists, Company of Thieves (Genevieve Schatz, Marc Walloch, Chris Faller, Marcin Sulewski) is full of ideas, whether the Chicago band is writing a concept album about a girl seeking independence in modern-day America or having the audacity to channel disparate influences like The Beatles, Billie Holliday, and Radiohead into its heady, catchy rock songs.</p><p>It's difficult to think of a harder-working group of musicians than the skilled players who make up Company of Thieves. These guys and gal are road warriors, and there's a good chance that they've already played your town a few times. They've toured with Annuals, OK Go, and The Hold Steady, played festivals like Lollapalooza and Mountain Jam, appeared on Last Call With Carson Daly, and Schatz and Walloch were given props by the veteran players when they performed on Live From Daryl's House. And it's no surprise that their songs have struck a chord with music fans both young and old: The timeless results feature an invigorating mix of rock and pop delivered with panache and soul, propelled by Schatz's powerful pipes and Walloch's inventive, expansive guitar work.

Despite a debilitating robbery in the second half of their tour, they finished with success and are back home in DC (Maryland proper) planning for a great 2012.

Passionate, but never preachy. Populist, but definitely not prosaic. New York City singer-songwriter, pianist and beatboxer Rachel Platten is by no means your average headliner-in-the-making. Her Rock Ridge Music debut, Be Here, is a bewitching collection of 10 wise-beyond-their-years piano-driven pop songs that echo elements of Alanis Morissette, Carole King, Tori Amos and Regina Spektor, while retaining a singular sense of self that is rarely found in such a young performer. Platten's uplifting, instantly catchy anthems celebrate the love and light in the world with a passionate intensity that has been missing on the radio dial for far too long.</p><p>Platten enrolled in a songwriting course at the Berklee College of Music before heading to New York City in the fall of 2006. Over the next four years, she wrote the songs that make up Be Here, put together a band and toured at every opportunity, scoring opening slots for The Strokes, Ziggy Marley, Regina Spektor, Tracy Bonham and Rusted Root. Her dynamic live shows earned raves from the Boston Globe, who called her ""breathtaking and brilliant,"" and the New York Post, who declared that she "" blend[ed] sweet delicateness with pluck.""</p><p>This praise is just the beginning for this vibrant singer-songwriter. Be Here is an ecstatic confirmation that pop music can have heart, soul, depth and gravity, while still inspiring you sing along at the top of your lungs. It's time to listen up and Be Here now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />Brooklyn-based indie artist Bess Rogers has had a lifetime fascination with evolution. But it wasn't until 4 years of nonstop touring and three independent releases that the science of life began to creep its way into her songs. Her new record, aptly titled Out Of The Ocean, is a bold step forward for Rogers, and one that she has been eager to take.</p><p>After earning a bachelors and masters degree in music composition from SUNY Purchase, she began a steady routine of recording and touring in support of her own music and as a back up singer and lead guitarist for indie-pop artist, Ingrid Michaelson. Like Rogers' live shows, the songs themselves have a huge dynamic range.Like her previous releases, Bess Rogers Presents Bess Rogers (2010), Travel Back EP (2009) and Decisions Based On Information (2007), Out Of The Ocean was made and released independently.</p><p>Bess' music has been featured on such television shows as One Tree Hill, Pretty Little Liars, Raising The Bar, and Switched At Birth, and a national Motts for Tots commercial. She has shared the stage with Ingrid Michaelson, Loudon Wainwright, Ari Hest, Ian Axel, Allie Moss and more.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Bess Rogers</span> <a href=""http://www.bessrogers.com/"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/bessrogers"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/bessrogers"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/bessrogersmusic"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fbess-rogers%252Fid254497967%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/bessrogers"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Frachel-platten%252Fid431528675%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/rachelplatten,"<iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/r61LFkzKzQQ"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/qI33yn-ilQ4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3224,Sandra McCracken,,,,,0,,,,,,3222,Aztec Two-Step 40th Anniversary Tour CD Release,,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Aztec-Two-Step/20537088164,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlZz7mTmquc,http://www.aztectwostep.com/,14761,"<p>In 1972, Aztec Two-Step, whose name comes from a poem by beat poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, burst upon the scene with their self-titled debut album on Elektra Records.

Their first album, along with their subsequent albums for RCA Records were staples of progressive FM and college radio and helped to bring the music of the 1960s into the 70s.</p><p><br />As their recording career continued, so did the critical acclaim. In 1987 Living in America received the New York Music Award for Best Folk Album and was named in Billboard's year-end critic's poll.

In 1999 they were the subjects of the documentary No Hit Wonder, aired on PBS.

After seeing them perform, there is no denying that they are not a typical trio. Coach Cotton is the ring-leader, frequently immersed in a sea of knee-high concert goers. Wearing a wireless head-set microphone, he wades through the mass of dancing children, dispersing high-fives and shaking a tambourine. Williebob provides the necessary string work for the show, moving among a collection of guitars, mandolins, and banjos while wearing a kazoo around his neck. Boogie Woogie Bennie is a one-man-band within the power trio, employing a contraption that one four-year-old fan described as ""the piano-drum"". The piano-drum allows Boogie Bennie to play the bass drum with his right foot, the snare drum and hi-hat cymbal with his left foot, and the keyboard with his hands (with his left hand playing the bass parts). Together, Rocknoceros is able to cover a dizzying range of musical styles in each set. From Tin Pan Alley to the shores of Jamaica, Rocknoceros hops from genre to genre like a toad on summer asphalt.</p><p>Having already released three award-winning records, the new album tells  tales of the Colonel and his friends in  their make-believe home of  Soggy Bog. The theme of ""Colonel Purple  Turtle"" is one of friendship  and working together, a subject that  matters to Coach, Boogie Woogie  Bennie, and Williebob, as the three  members of Rockncoeros have been  best friends since they were children.  The record reflects their  abiding trust in each other, and their desire  to share the message of  camaraderie through song.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/rocknoceros/id258825234?uo=4&partnerId=30,,,,3196,Brian Glennon,,,,,0,,,,,,3195,Find Vienna,,http://www.facebook.com/findvienna,http://www.youtube.com/user/findviennamusic,http://wearefindvienna.com/,0,"<p>Find Vienna is a band from Philadelphia, PA who has been riding on the success of their Debut EP ""In Your Favorite Colors.""

Songs are massive combining heavy guitars, shot-gun drums, extraordinary bass lines, endless harmonies, and unforgettable hooks. Influences are varied (Stones, JET, Foo, Queen, QOTSA, Zeppelin, Beatles) but not overt or overdone as each song is performed via the musical talents of four very different rock and roll souls - from a Berklee trained bass player and trumpet-trained lead guitar player, to a self-taught country picker and a drummer from a marching band. This rare mix of rock'n'rolla's produces powerful tracks that give listeners' multiple influences in every song. The band's first studio album, Stay Gold Sessions (available @ iTunes and CD Baby), was a stripped down, self-produced affair recorded live in early 2007 in an attempt to capture the band's raw energy and pop hooks. Stay Gold Sessions was followed up by multiple live performances including the 2008 and 2009 Shamrock Festivals in Washington DC (DC area's biggest St. Patrick's Day Festival).

As the lead singer and guitarist of The Presidents of the United States of America, Chris Ballew is used to rocking out in front of millions of fans. Today, Chris is rockin' to a younger set as Caspar Babypants. Ballew's first brush with children's music came in 2002 when he recorded and donated an album of traditional children's songs to the nonprofit Program for Early Parent Support titled ""PEPS Sing A Long!"" Ballew began digging up nursery rhymes and folk songs in the public domain, songs that have been reinterpreted and passed down through generations. This, in addition to a number of original songs, formed his first full-length release, ""Here I Am!""</p><p>The album was a hit locally, and Ballew began to perform in the Seattle area. A longtime friend, Fred Northup, heard the album while working on a project with Ballew, and Northup offered to play as his live percussionist. Northup, a Seattle-based comedy improvisor, suggested his frequent collaborator Ron Hippe as a keyboard player, and Ballew subsequently auditioned Hippe. Christening the two ""Frederick Babyshirt"" and ""Ronald Babyshoes"", they officially became the Caspar Babypants live band in 2009.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fcaspar-babypants%252Fid411492514%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/casparbabypants,,3157,Aaron Crawford and The Badcards,,http://www.facebook.com/people/Aaron-Crawford/1098632813,http://www.youtube.com/user/AaronCrawfordMusic,http://www.aaroncrawfordmusic.com/fr_home.cfm,16279,"<p>When you listen to Aaron Crawford you're instantly struck; by his sound - part So Cal punk, part rockabilly, part rootsy troubadour, by his songwriting - honest, open and relatable, and by his obvious fearlessness to stand up for what he believes in, no matter what the cost. His desire for truth shows in the musical messages Crawford delivers in his songs. Not one to walk away from something he's passionate about, it motivates him to hold the bar high for himself. A bold performer, who fronted punk scenesters Rude Buddha, he stops at nothing to achieve his goal. ""I'm inspired by any story, or person who has had to fight to get what they have, and lives with no regrets.""</p><p>In February 2011, Aaron entered Hollywood Sound Recorders, a Los Angeles based studio with Producer/Percussionist Larry Ciancia, who's studio and performance credits include artists like Ben Taylor, Fiona Apple, Everlast, Ray LaMontagne, Carly Simon and Herbie Hancock. Ciancia's first task was getting a band around Aaron to compliment his diverse writing style. In doing so he enlisted the help of guitarist Joel Shearer (Alanis Morrisette, Pedestrian, Dido) to engineer and perform on the record as well as keyboardist Adam Macdougall (The Black Crowes, Macy Gray) to fill out the recordings, giving them a vintage rock sound full of life, character, and soul. Ken Barnum, D.C. punk bassist, engineer and good friend of Aaron's was also brought on to fill out this incredible studio band. During a short pre-production period, Ciancia had Aaron co-write with a few different writers including '09 Grammy winner Joshua Lopez on a song called ""Next to You"", an energetic ""Clash"" style number that Aaron fell in love with the moment he heard it. Then the group hit the studio. The recording sessions, described by Aaron as ""magical and memorable"" proved amazing, cranking out 5 completed songs in 4 days of tracking! Shortly after, Shawn Everett was brought on to mix. Shawn, best known for his work with Weezer, Jakob Dylan and Pete Yorn, brought out the best in the recordings, which can be heard throughout the LA sessions. ""Bad Habit"" which has enough back to be appreciated by even the most hardcore rapper, is a song of revelation and realization, discussing the age old topic; ""Is it the sex or the person?"" The track slams throughout, moving from hip danceable verses, to huge pop choruses, while ""Don't Stop"" and ""Let Go"" show the honesty, and relate ability of a good song, discussing topics of believing in someone, and moving on. Of the newly recorded numbers, ""Breathe"" is the most intimate, explaining that music is Aaron's home, and through music he is never without shelter. Adam MacDougall's performance on the grand piano in ""Breathe"", turns this song into a beautiful ballad reminiscent of early Elton John that will take your breath away.</p><p>Aaron then headed home and combined these recordings, with recordings from late 2010, which includes the songs, ""Sick Sick Love"", a grungy brit-rock banger discussing the topic of using sex as a weapon to elevate, and rise above drama, ""Black White Radio"", which asks the question ""should I waste my time on MTV""? And Locket, a mysterious Latin influenced punk song about a key and lock Aaron wears around his heart to complete the yet to be released album, ""The Wager"". Brian Lucey, who received a Grammy for his work with The Black Keys in 2011, was brought on to master and complete the record. Bratty at times, honest and direct at others, ""The Wager"" truly encompasses Aaron's wont back down spirit and showcases his ability with maturity and swagger. Song writing is Aaron's base, on some tracks beautiful and gentle, on others combative and belligerent, but never hiding behind a mixed message. With Aaron Crawford, what you hear is what you get.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Faaron-crawford-the-badcards%252Fid504785442%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/aaroncrawfrd,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/QtJMR0Y2Rh4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3155,T.Vibe,,,,http://www.reverbnation.com/TVIBE,12804,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Joseph is a young, up and coming rapper out of Reston, Virginia.

After auditioning several singers without luck, the band finally found Adam. The new dynamics of the group helped to jumpstart the band's productivity and Sub-Radio Standard was officially born. The band quickly began writing original songs as well as learning covers. Since 2009, they have successfully recorded a seven-song EP and have many more songs in the making.

Their newest singles - an electro cover of Toto's ""Hold the Line"" and the rapid-fire hard-style / rock hybrid ""Breathe"" are a testament to how far the band has come from their early days of strumming out Nirvana songs in the garage. Hailing from the east coast of the United States, Ketura's music crosses borders effortlessly, at once both cosmic and personable. Their songs deal with day-to-day life in a big way, giving dramatic expression to the thoughts, feelings and questions we all experience. Ketura's sound - both in the studio and live - is often described as ""too big"" to have come from two people. Drummer Bert Windsor and vocalist / synthist / guitarist Daniel Stapleton met when they were children. Their first conversation involved starting a band together, and they've been playing music ever since.

The first six songs came together as the self-released EP The Fiery Works, which the duo put out as a free download on their Web site. As word spread online, the band's fanbase grew along with Weiland and Soucy's excitement to get back to recording. Continuing with the formula of self-producing, The Fiery Works II followed shortly afterward and was also released as a free download. Within the next year, the digital releases were downloaded over 12,000 times and the group prepared for a live setting with the addition of Tucker Yaro on bass. After playing several shows and writing a batch of new songs over the next few months, the newfound trio prepared themselves to record a full-length record Have You Seen My Prefrontal Cortex?

In his native Australia, though, where his songs are lodged deeply in the country's soundtrack, Kelly is virtually a national hero. In a career that spans more than 30 years, Kelly has released a steady stream of albums that showcase his emotionally vivid, musically expansive songwriting, capturing the essence of the Australian landscape while demonstrating Kelly's uncanny ability to distill a novel's worth of narrative and character detail into a straightforward, effortlessly accessible melodic pop tune.</p><p>In the years since the release of his 1981 debut album Talk, Kelly has maintained a prolific pace that's helped to win him a permanent place in the hearts of fans around the world. He traveled extensively around Australia during his youth before settling in Melbourne, where he quickly established himself as a force in that city's diverse musical community. Gossip became Kelly's first U.S. release on A&amp;M Records, which also issued his Under the Sun and So Much Water So Close to Home. Those albums won him reams of stateside critical acclaim, while expanding his loyal U.S. fan base.</p><p>Kelly has won also won numerous awards, including eight Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Music Awards, and was induced into that organization's Hall of Fame in 1997. In spanning his entire recording career, Songs From the South (Volumes 1 &amp; 2) demonstrates that Paul Kelly's recent output has remained as adventurous and compelling as the early work that first established him as a major artist. His songs remain as fresh and inspired as ever.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fpaul-kelly%252Fid4699754%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,,"<iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/02XQ_Ttln9c"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",3072,Gabe Dixon,http://www.myspace.com/gabedixon,http://www.facebook.com/gabedixonband,http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Eig5zDdy4AU,http://gabedixon.com/,12828,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Huffington Post named Gabe Dixon's One Spark album amongst the ""Best Music Of 2011,"" Record Collector says Dixon is ""a fresh new voice in the power-pop firmament,"" and legendary artist Jackson Browne writes ""it's been a while since I've heard something so original.""

When the band went on hiatus in 2004, Leigh released her first solo records, Blue on Blue, and a Christmas album Wishing For This, both in 2006. She collaborated with ambient dance band, Delerium, on Fauxliage in 2007. In 2008, Nash and Slocum reunited as Sixpence None the Richer to record Dawn of Grace, and are set to release Lost in Transition in early 2012.

Since their 1981 debut, Hard N' Heavy, the group - which was co-founded by singer/guitarist Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow and drummer Robb Reiner - has been listed by many as one of the creators of the thrash/speed metal genre (especially on such Chris Tsangarides-produced classics as 1982's Metal on Metal and 1983's Forged in Fire).  Anvil has never stopped rocking, and with the arrival of the critically-acclaimed/surprise hit film, ""Anvil! The Story of Anvil"" (directed by Sacha Gervasi), the group is back where they belong - at the forefront of heavy metal. Anvil has always been taken seriously by metalheads, including some very well known ones, who praise the band in the film.</p><p>Having issued a total of seventeen releases between 1981 and 2004, the group, that also includes bassist Glenn Five, reconnected with Tsangarides (Thin Lizzy, Judas Priest) for their thirteenth studio album, eighteenth release overall, This is Thirteen. The turbulent-yet-triumphant sessions were well-documented in the ""Anvil!"" film. ""It differs in one vast sense - the production,"" explains Reiner. ""&lsquo;This is Thirteen' was produced by Chris Tsangarides, who produced &lsquo;Metal on Metal' and &lsquo;Forged in Fire' - probably the most famous, classic Anvil albums.</p><p>As evidenced by such vintage Anvil-sounding ragers as ""Feed the Greed,"" ""American Refugee,"" and the title track, This is Thirteen is certainly the strongest Anvil release in a long time. Originally put out by the band themselves and sold through their website, the album is now seeing proper national distribution via CD (with ""Thumb Hang"" added as a bonus track) as well as a double gate-fold vinyl version (including two additional bonus tracks) through VH1 Classic Records. Additionally, due to the film's success, Anvil received an invite from AC/DC to open mammoth football stadium shows for the legendary Aussie rockers on their ""Black Ice"" tour, while a book about the group's career (which shares the same name as the movie) appeared as well. Add to it a DVD release of the movie in the Fall of 2009, and a new studio album that is already written and just needs to be recorded (titled Juggernaut of Justice), and it certainly appears as though Anvil is making the most out of their ""second life.""</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blending elements of classic thrash with modern power, melodic sensibility with exciting unpredictability, and catchy hooks with aggressive delivery, Division proves that stellar songwriting and compelling lyrical content never go out of style. Hailing from the morass of frustration that is of our nation's capital, this undeniably contemporary, and unapologetically metal, band has a long history of leveling audiences with its massive sonic assault.

The name is a satire, intended to convey the point that in an industry where there is such a focus on instant gratification, great things still take time, patience, dedication and, most of all, hard work. In May of 2010, Rome In A Day decided to undergo another large transformation, which included the amicable departure of drummer Adam Lee and the addition of two new members: Guitarist Tom Benca and drummer Kris Combs. The music also shifted from melodic hard rock to metal, including more intricate guitar styling, double bass inspired drums, implementation of various odd time signatures and increased vocal aggression.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Rome In A Day</span>&nbsp; <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/Romeinaday"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/romeinadaymusic"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/romeinaday"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Frome-in-a-day%252Fid316704165%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=FP0FcO9qzYY"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />Defending Cain is a melodic and groove driven heavy metal band from the eastern panhandle of West Virginia.

There's something wonderfully original about Andy Grammer. Beautifully blending classic and modern styles into a catchy cocktail of genuine pop, Andy's music is one part John Legend, one part Maroon 5 with a splash of Lauryn Hill. He carries a moving spark to his sound that's unique in every sense of the word, while wielding a confidence that is reminiscent of rock n' roll's glory days.</p><p>Establishing himself as a Road Dog, Andy hasn't stopped stacking up the gigs. He's played over 100 colleges to date across the country, from Duke to UCLA, and opened for some of the industry's brightest stars, including Plain White T's and Josh Kelley. The demand continues to grow from his thousands of loyal followers coast to coast. Named one of Billboard's 2011 Artists to Watch, the singer recorded the album in New York and Los Angeles with a collection of top producers, including Matt Wallace (Faith No More, Maroon 5), S*A*M &amp; Sluggo (Train, Neon Trees) and Barrett Yeretsian (Christina Perri).His songs are a throwback to the greats that have come before, and a path that paves the way for what's to come next.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the title of the New York rocker's Atlantic debut provocatively suggests, Star's whole life has been building to this point. The songs on ""11:59"" play out in real time, the stories spin out in narratives that resonate with urgency and truth. Star's often stripped-bare vocals give the songs an added resonance. For ""11:59,"" Star partnered with producer Matt Serletic (matchbox twenty, Collective Soul), who artfully understood how to combine Star's storytelling style with his modern sensibilities. Howard Benson (Daughtry, My Chemical Romance) provided additional production to bring out his rock roots. For more than half his life, Star has been a fiery performer.</p><p>Born and raised in Long Island, N.Y., by the time Star was 14 he regularly traveled to Manhattan to play clubs, including the legendary CBGB's. Enter his decision to compete on CBS's 2006 reality show ""Rock Star: Supernova"" as a way to take his music directly to the viewers. And the viewers loved him: Star's high-octane performances quickly became fan favorites as they highlighted both his stellar musicianship and natural- born showmanship.</p><p><span style=""color: #808080;"">Ryan Star</span> <a href=""http://www.rstar.net/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/RYANSTAR"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/rstar"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/ryanstar"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fryan-star%252Fid162820139%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/rstar"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Action Item is an up &amp; coming Pop band out of New Jersey.

He has a voice of a peculiar angel, soft as a kiss, which has the ability to warm the coldest of hearts. He is Teitur (Tie-tor) Lassen, a man from the Faroe Islands who turns music into magic beautifully and effortlessly.</p><p>In 2002, Teitur was signed by the legendary Doug Morris to Universal Records in the US. And in 2003, Teitur released his first album, Poetry &amp; Aeroplanes. Its simple, sincere songs made it a critical hit. He toured the USA and Canada extensively, initially working the East coast, then slowly building audiences all over North America, performed on chat shows, live radio sessions, was featured on MTV's You Hear It First, VH1 and CNN, watched as his songs got snapped up for film soundtracks (My Super Ex-Girlfriend and Aquamarine), and attracted the attention of respected singer-songwriters like Rufus Wainwright, Aimee Mann and John Mayer, all of whom took him on tour, from theatres to a large arena tour with Mayer.</p><p>In 2006 Teitur left Universal. He and his manager started their own label, and called it Arlo and Betty Recordings (after his two guitars). He released his second album Stay Under The Stars in the same year, a record full of richer writing and bolder characters, which went Gold in Denmark, spawning the huge radio hit ""Louis Louis,"" and established him as a major star in Scandinavia and built his reputation across Continental Europe.</p><p>In 2007, Teitur also fulfilled a lifetime ambition by releasing an album in his mother tongue, Kata Hornid, before beginning work in late that year on The Singer, recorded in a Swedish Princess's house in Gotland, released in 2008 in Europe and early 2009 in the UK, his first album to be issued in Britain.</p><p>The Singer garnered five star reviews in the UK in The Guardian (""deep, viscous stuff that is never less than extraordinary"") and The Independent (""a rare beast""), while the Sunday Times praised the singer-songwriter's ""wonderfully idiosyncratic talent"".</p><p>Then, in October 2009, the UK only release album All My Mistakes, a kind of &lsquo;introduction to/best of' took us through the last seven years of Teitur's glittering career and revealed the marvellous jewels from his back catalogue. Achieving his second Album of The Week in The Independent, Andy Gill wrote of the album: ""...there's more than enough evidence here to bear out Teitur's assertion, in the title-track, that 'all my mistakes have become masterpieces' "".</p><p>During early 2010, Teitur recorded his stunning new album Let the Dog Drive Home in Denmark and mixed in Norway, an album which combines the quality of songs from his first album, with the broad appeal of his second, and some of the coolness of the third, The Singer. Teitur's new album is scheduled for release in Scandinavia on October 4, 2010 and the rest of the world in early 2011.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fteitur%252Fid1965685%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/teitur,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""255"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/k5z4XokYpPw"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",2995,Bandits & Beggars,,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Bandits-Beggars/127073824014847,,http://www.banditsandbeggars.com/,14738,"<p>Having only been around for less than a year, Bandits &amp; Beggars has  already made their mark on the East Coast.

This idea began to materialize with the two friends writing awful, acoustic, 3 Doors Down-esque songs that they recorded on garage band (for the record, those songs have since been deleted). But, it didn't matter how bad the songs were, they loved writing music and couldn't get enough. The two friends agreed that simply writing acoustic music wasn't cutting it anymore and decided to begin a band.  So with the help of Falon Lewis (drums), Matt Oberdorfer (guitar), and Justin Pugrant (bass), Breaking Borders was formed.

MCT features Clem on guitar, mandola, harp &amp; mouth, and he is sandwiched by two fine fellow Charlottesville VA music chums, Rusty Speidel (of SGGL fame) on guitar &amp; higher vocals, plus Thomas Gunn (of Lost Highway) on upright bass &amp; lonesomer vocals.  A surprise guest or two may not be out of the question... Clem owes EVERYbody money.  Come out, hear some of their new material, and have some cake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ushering in a new golden age of live entertainment is Ted Garber, a genre-bending multi-instrumentalist whose ""BluesAmericanaRock"" combines classic showmanship with a captivating singer-songwriter sensibility. Ted kicked off his career performing covers on the streets of New Orleans for tips, where he balanced academic studies at Tulane University with his passion for playing.  Inspired by the vibrancy of the city and realizing his natural ability to connect with a crowd, he honed his talent for original material.  He went on to open for the likes of Pat McGee and has performed in venues as diverse as DC's legendary 9:30 Club, LA's The Viper Room, and Nashville's Bluebird Cafe.  He was also named DC's Top Entertainer by WUSA-Channel 9, and won On Tap Magazine's Battle of the Bands ""Taste of Arlington"" Competition in 2006. Ted won a 2010 Washington Area Music Award (WAMA) for ""Pop Rock Recording of the Year,"" recognizing his late-2009 studio album, ""American Rail.""</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Ted Garber</span> <a href=""http://www.tedgarber.com/home"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/TEDGARBERMUSIC"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/tedgarbermusic"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fted-garber%252Fid340740994%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/tedgarbermusic"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/michael-clem/id403655814?uo=4&partnerId=30,,,,2981,"Vince Scheuerman (River James, Army Of Me)",,,,,0,,,,,,2979,JUKE KARTEL at Sixth and I Historic Synagogue,,,,,0,,,,,,2978,HURT,http://www.myspace.com/hurt,https://www.facebook.com/hurt,http://www.youtube.com/user/hurt,http://www.hurtband.com/,11833,"<p><span style=""color: #808080;""><strong><span style=""color: #800000;""><span style=""color: #ffffff;"">@ Sixth and I Historic Synagogue - Washington, D.C&nbsp; </span><br /></span></strong></span></p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: arial,helvetica,FreeSans,'Nimbus Sans L',Garuda,Utkal,sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; font-size: medium;""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: #414141; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;""><br /></span></span></p><p>HURT is an apt name for a band that has been exploring man's struggle with the human condition.  J. Loren Wince has crafted 4 critically acclaimed and smart studio albums that reveal as much of his philosophy as  his musical perfectionism, and 2009's Goodbye to The Machine doubled down on Hurt's brand of intelligent hard rock with a heavy dose of insight of our collective humanity.  Hurt is a purveyor of divine tragedy and J. Loren's depiction of personal suffering on the micro and macro level has come full circle with the band's soon to be released 5th studio album The Crux (Street date 3/27/2012 on Carved Records), which will entertain and illuminate and, as the title implies, get to the heart of the matter.<br /> <br />The release of The Crux also marks another milestone for Hurt as they have signed with Carved Records for what will be a new multi-album relationship. According to J. Loren, ""We made the decision for Carved Records to be our new home because they truly are one of the few companies that continues to believe in rock oriented artists and their music. With their solid commitment to growing and working bands in an uncertain musical climate, we felt this was the right fit for HURT.""<br /> <br />The Label, the Band and Management's approach to this new album will be to take HURT on a &lsquo;pre-THE CRUX-release' Acoustic Tour starting in St Louis on October 29, 2010.  ""At the heart of HURT is this perfect combination of musical math and poetry and a musicianship that can get lost in all the media noise,"" states Phil Thomas, Carved Records VP of Operation who goes on to elaborate, ""...we believe these guys deserve the attention and platform for their art and to borrow their own title, The Crux of their art is their live shows and in order to give this band the runway we asked them to re-think their previous hit songs and to push the envelope of their art and talent and do this &lsquo;Acoustic Performance Tour' as a prelude to The Crux release and 2012 touring.""  Simply stated: ""...we want to give HURT fans a chance to reconnect with HURT and experience the gravity of their music at a basic level.""  HURT Fans will get to see J. Loren (vocals &amp; violin), Michael Roberts (guitar), Rek Mohr (bass), Victor Ribas (drums) with a cellist and have an exclusive opportunity to hear the band not only reinterpret classic HURT hits like ""Falls Apart,"" ""Rapture,"" ""Wars,"" as well as being the first to hear new songs from The Crux.  ""We're excited to showcase familiar tunes in a new light with our upcoming acoustic tour. It has been something that fans have been requesting for quite some time and, as musicians, it is also important for us to keep reinventing ourselves, even if sometimes that means going back to the roots. Most of these songs were written on acoustic instruments and it is one of the strengths of this band that I look forward to sharing with you. See you there.""</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fhurt%252Fid2517297%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/#!/hurtofficial,,2975,Kids These Days,,http://facebook.com/kidsthesedaysband,http://youtube.com/kidsthesedaysband,,11685,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p><br />The members who make up Chicago-bred band Kids These Days hail from every corner of the music spectrum and varying neighborhoods of Chicago, but their collective sound creates a hybrid genre influenced by equal parts jazz, funk, blues, soul and hip-hop. With three horns, a rapper, a blues rock trio, and a female singer packing a voice with gusto way beyond her years, the Kids simultaneously represent a golden era in music and an exciting prospect of the future. Their EP, ""Hard Times,"" has reigned in fans from as far as Europe, but their most undeniable strength lies in the contagious energy at their live shows.</p><p>After beating out 150 other Chicago bands of all-ages to win first place in the Congress Theater's Next Big Thing battle of the bands in November of 2009, Kids These Days had officially begun their journey. They have shared the stage with noted hip-hop artists Rhymefest, the Cool Kids, Mic Terror, and Dom Kennedy, and proved they knew how to bring a mainstream, relatable appeal to every kind of audience.&nbsp; After gaining almost instant local acclaim, the Kids began to compose their own music, spawned from the mistakes made during rehearsals and late night freestyle riffs. Since then, word of their music has gone global. With close to 8,000 fans on Facebook and a smashing debut at SXSW, Kids These Days have the industry talking and the internet buzzing, with new fans and seasoned fans alike frequently requesting digital releases, more music videos and hometown concerts.</p><p>Authenticity builds on itself, and Kids These Days can claim a degree of it that has become a rarity in today's over-produced musical atmosphere. Their youth supplies them with an unabashed, raw attitude towards performing and creating that is fueled by an appreciation of music in its truest form. They crowd surf. They freestyle. They dance. They're Kids. But their sound will blow you away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mercury Rising is from Silver Spring, MD. Created in Cali and rockin with love of the DMV on its back. From the demise of a few old bands and the collaboration of melodic and chaotic styles Mercury Rising is able to woo listeners with our slower tunes and get you dancing all in the same motion. Making an immediate name for ourselves in the Local Hip Hop scene has been a big goal for the band due to how and where we grow up. And Working with platinum selling pop stars and modifying the direction of the music from the tutelage of Mars Volta's Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Cedric Bixler-Zavala we have been able to gain the greatest knowledge that we could have acquired, which simply were the words ""Keep it Real"", -Omar</p><p>While the rock scene in DC remains faithful to itself, Mercury Rising is bringing back the independence that once was REAL ROCK AND ROLL. With the diversity of the band and cultural attributes from members representing Panama, Colombia, El Salvador, and Mexico Mercury Rising ads in latin flavor, as well as R&amp;B influence into each set we play.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Mercury Rising</span>&nbsp; <a href=""http://facebook.com/MercuryRising33"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Frontman Joe Keith and bass guitarist Eric Daniel formed Nine Days  Gone in 2009. Drummer Luke Thomas joined shortly after. The band writes  and records all of their music in their studio in Fairfax, VA. Thier  Influences come from alternative/punk bands like Green Day and Blink  182. Nine Days Gone started playing shows in the Summer of 2011, and  since then they have gained popularity across the DC metro area. With  music featured on the radio, a full album on iTunes, and a supporting  fanbase, Nine Days Gone hopes to continue their success as they prepare  to release their second album in late 2011.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Nine Days Gone</span> <a href=""http://www.ninedaysgone.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/ninedaysgone"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/ninedaysgone"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=361421653486&amp;ref=ts"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/ninedaysgone"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Formed in 2011, Fallworth has been described as nothing short of   remarkable.  Combining rock, strong melodic vocals, classical piano with   hard techno-centric beats, and wailing heavy guitar riffs, this   up-and-coming trio has hit a major stride.  Influences as wide as   Rachmanninoff to Radiohead, Smashing Pumpkins to Muse, Rage Against the   Machine to Mute Math can be heard in their music.  Lead vocalist and   guitarist/keyboardist, Sean Mahon, started this as a solo project;   producing and recording his original music in his home studio until he   crossed paths with bassist/guitarist, JFork (from Cobbler, The War   Within, and Pebble to Pearl), and with drummer, Justin LaMora (formerly   of Chained Down).  After making their official debut just a mere month   ago, Fallworth battled it out in this year's KollaborationDC  competition  to an audience of 700 plus, and took home 3rd place.  They  are already  creating quite a buzz and steadily increasing their  fan-base beyond the  DC area.  Fallworth will soon be going into the  studio in hopes of  releasing their first EP later this year.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Fallworth</span> <a href=""http://www.fallworth.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/#%21/fallworthmusic"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> |&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/officialFallworth"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/officialFallworth"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An evolution of the project All Five Seasons, A Raven On The Rosary  takes some of the sounds of that band and mixes it with hair metal and  classic rock, breathing new life into a music scene consumed by cliche  and standards.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">A Raven On The Rosary</span> &nbsp; <a href=""http://twitter.com/#%21/ROTRMusic"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> |&nbsp; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/aravenontherosary"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a></p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fkids-these-days%252Fid434094849%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/kidsthesedays,,2970,Meet & Greet,,,,,0,,,,,,2968,The Downtown Fiction: Special Acoustic Matinee,http://myspace.com/thedowntownfiction,http://www.facebook.com/thedowntownfiction,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUgfKyLnSK0&feature=player_embedded,http://www.thedowntownfiction.com/,11744,"<p><span style=""color: #999999;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p><span style=""color: #ffffff;""><strong>Space is limited to the first 100 people who buy tickets to this special event with TDF!

Citing influences ranging from Green Day to The Rolling Stones, the pop-rock trio has a sound comparable to the likes of Jimmy Eat World, Blink 182, and The All-American Rejects. On March 3rd, 2010, TDF released their first EP ""Best I Never Had"" to a long climb up the iTunes chart. With a blossoming number of dedicated followers on multiple social networking sites and a YouTube channel currently boasting 5,000 subscribers and surpassing a whopping 1,000,000 views, TDF is well on their way to taking over the media world.</p><p>The Downtown Fiction has been building a reputation for working hard and touring constantly alongside their contemporaries; making appearances on this past summer's Bamboozle Road Show with headliners Boys Like Girls and All Time Low, as well as the 2010 Vans Warped Tour. With a loyal fan base that just keeps growing, TDF has created a perfect experience for their fans and for music lovers everywhere, providing an entertaining live show in addition to their high-energy music. And not only has The Downtown Fiction made it their goal to road trip across America with their catchy tunes, but they've also made a point to travel the globe; hitting up Japan in the fall of 2010 with We The Kings before embarking on a full US tour as the main supporting act with The Summer Set.</p><p>In addition to their world travels, (including rocking cities with The Ready Set on the Glamour Kills Tour) and popularity-gaining EP's, TDF's music has been circling the world in another form - by being featured on some of the most popular TV shows around. Besides their debut video for ""I Just Wanna Run"" premiering on MTV Hits, MTV2, and MTV U; their music can be heard throughout the second season of MTV's Jersey Shore, and has been featured on other shows like The Hard Times of RJ Berger, The Challenge: Fresh Meat II, The Hills, and Keeping Up With The Kardashians. With fans across America and even in South Asia, TDF proves to be on a musical mission.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-downtown-fiction/id304215792?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/downtownfiction,,2967,John Doe (from X) Full Band CD

They formed in the music venue Jammin Java in their native Virginia one fateful afternoon at the suggestion of mutual friends. After playing for a few hours in a little practice room, magic started exploding everywhere, and they felt like they'd just found another planet! They immediately went to the booker for Jammin Java (who eventually became their manager) and said, ""Please book our CD release show at your earliest convenience,"" to which he replied, ""Do you have a CD?"". They did not. They booked a show anyway. That was only two years ago, and the rest is history.</p><p>Though a young band, they're no rookies to the stage. Native Run can be seen at the Austin City Limits Music Festival, and Paste Magazine called Native Run ""The Best of What's Next."" Collectively, they bring to bear influences from Shakespeare to Springsteen, and from Patsy Cline to Keith Urban.</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/deep-river/id407142931?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/#!/nativerunmusic,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Gmu1GBTiLnU"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",2960,Space Program,http://www.myspace.com/spaceprogramband,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Space-Program/134076666636505,http://www.youtube.com/user/SpaceProgramBand,http://spaceprogram.bandcamp.com/,12042,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With an energetic and eclectic sound, Space Program is a Washington D.C. based band that came on the scene in 2010.

Relocating to the DC area, Mokey Doris grew and convulsed under the blazing moon and herbal rain. Their train stops here, it seems, in a most refreshing way, calling the children to board and enter into the distant glow. Mokey Doris welcomes the coming of the glow, and teaches those who will listen to welcome it too.</p><p>Mokey Doris officially formed in 2010, crusty with the cakings of acid drenched consciousness. Once they gathered together their lineup, including Cody (Kalem's brother) who dropped out of college for the project (what a guy!), they began rehearsing 3-5 times a week in friend Rob's basement. Ben Ghobashi has been a constant whisperer of strange melodies, filming butterflies and dancing with demons. Eager to send their vibrations through brainstems, they petitioned drummer Mike, who agreed to pound the glow closer with a surprising grin. And Robert, playing with the twinkles that were secretly given to him by, as legend has it, Bobby the shaman (of Georgia).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,http://twitter.com/#!/MokeyDoris,,2952,Mercury Rising,,http://facebook.com/MercuryRising33,,,0,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mercury Rising is from Silver Spring, MD. Created in Cali and rockin with love of the DMV on its back. From the demise of a few old bands and the collaboration of melodic and chaotic styles Mercury Rising is able to woo listeners with our slower tunes and get you dancing all in the same motion. Making an immediate name for ourselves in the Local Hip Hop scene has been a big goal for the band due to how and where we grow up. And Working with platinum selling pop stars and modifying the direction of the music from the tutelage of Mars Volta's Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Cedric Bixler-Zavala we have been able to gain the greatest knowledge that we could have acquired, which simply were the words ""Keep it Real"", -Omar</p><p>While the rock scene in DC remains faithful to itself, Mercury Rising is bringing back the independence that once was REAL ROCK AND ROLL.

Nine Days Gone started playing shows in the Summer of 2011, and since then they have gained popularity across the DC metro area. With music featured on the radio, a full album on iTunes, and a supporting fanbase, Nine Days Gone hopes to continue their success as they prepare to release their second album in late 2011.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Nine Days Gone</span> <a href=""http://www.ninedaysgone.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/ninedaysgone"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/ninedaysgone"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=361421653486&amp;ref=ts"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/ninedaysgone"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Formed in 2011, Fallworth has been described as nothing short of  remarkable.

Lead vocalist and  guitarist/keyboardist, Sean Mahon, started this as a solo project;  producing and recording his original music in his home studio until he  crossed paths with bassist/guitarist, JFork (from Cobbler, The War  Within, and Pebble to Pearl), and with drummer, Justin LaMora (formerly  of Chained Down).  After making their official debut just a mere month  ago, Fallworth battled it out in this year's KollaborationDC competition  to an audience of 700 plus, and took home 3rd place.  They are already  creating quite a buzz and steadily increasing their fan-base beyond the  DC area.  Fallworth will soon be going into the studio in hopes of  releasing their first EP later this year.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Fallworth</span> <a href=""http://www.fallworth.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/fallworthmusic"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> |&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/officialFallworth"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/officialFallworth"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An evolution of the project All Five Seasons, A Raven On The Rosary takes some of the sounds of that band and mixes it with hair metal and classic rock, breathing new life into a music scene consumed by cliche and standards.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">A Raven On The Rosary</span> &nbsp; <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/ROTRMusic"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> |&nbsp; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/aravenontherosary"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a></p>",,,,,2946,Acoustic guitar workshops with Luke Brindley!,,,,http://lukebrindley.com/workshops,11819,"<p>The guitar workshops with Luke Brindley are held at <a href=""http://themusicschoolonline.com/"">The Music School at Jammin Java</a></p><p>Players of all backgrounds are welcome but to make the most of these workshops you should be at least an intermediate guitarist - be comfortable playing fingerstyle, moving around the neck, playing barre chords, etc. They are two hours long and space is limited!

You already know what the rest of the country is  starting to find  out - that Rocknoceros is a gem of a band.""</p><p>""An outstanding mix of folk and rock...literate songs...poppy approach...multi-generational appeal."" - <strong>NPR, Best Music for Kids and Families</strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>*Rocknoceros will do a full-fledged countdown and an apple juice toast for all!</strong></p><p>As every family with youngsters in the DC area already knows, Rocknoceros (pronounced like rhinoceros) is three guys: Coach Cotton, Williebob, and Boogie Woogie Bennie. After seeing them perform, there is no denying that they are not a typical trio. Coach Cotton is the ring-leader, frequently immersed in a sea of knee-high concert goers. Wearing a wireless head-set microphone, he wades through the mass of dancing children, dispersing high-fives and shaking a tambourine. Williebob provides the necessary string work for the show, moving among a collection of guitars, mandolins, and banjos while wearing a kazoo around his neck. Boogie Woogie Bennie is a one-man-band within the power trio, employing a contraption that one four-year-old fan described as ""the piano-drum"". The piano-drum allows Boogie Bennie to play the bass drum with his right foot, the snare drum and hi-hat cymbal with his left foot, and the keyboard with his hands (with his left hand playing the bass parts). Together, Rocknoceros is able to cover a dizzying range of musical styles in each set. From Tin Pan Alley to the shores of Jamaica, Rocknoceros hops from genre to genre like a toad on summer asphalt.</p><p>Having already released three award-winning records, Rocknoceros will be releasing their first kid-friendly concept album, ""Colonel Purple Turtle"". The new album tells tales of the Colonel and his friends in their make-believe home of Soggy Bog. The theme of ""Colonel Purple Turtle"" is one of friendship and working together, a subject that matters to Coach, Boogie Woogie Bennie, and Williebob, as the three members of Rockncoeros have been best friends since they were children. The record reflects their abiding trust in each other, and their desire to share the message of camaraderie through song.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Frocknoceros%252Fid258825234%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/#!/coachcotton,,2937,Val

looks and charm could ever be lonely, but it wasn&rsquo;t until this year that Val Emmich was joined by his band The Veeries in the studio and out on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp; His witty nature not only comes out in his music, but also his endearing videos that compliment.&nbsp; Believe us, it&rsquo;s well worth the wasted time at your work computer!</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span

known for their wall of sound approach, with soaring guitars, sneering vocals and a massive rhythm section. The New Yorker dubbed the band's debut self-titled EP, released in early 2010, ""radio friendly indie-rock"", and the overwhelming amount of positive feedback the band has received since assures that Blackbells is no flash in the pan. The EP hit the #18 spot in CMJ's Top 200, and ever since the band has found themselves playing to sold-out crowds across the US and Canada with the likes of Band of Skulls, Alberta Cross, Crash Kings, and The Greenhornes as well as appearances at both CMJ and SXSW in 2010 and 2011. With influences ranging from Echo and the Bunnymen to Oasis and contemporaries Band of Skulls, Blackbells have worked to create a unique aesthetic that breaks new ground.</p><p><!--[if gte mso

of New York, New York. The band consists of Thornfin Nguyen on Vocals and Guitar, Lead Guitarist Chris Potter, Zach Falkow on bass and Josh Ridley on drums. From it's humble beginnings as a solo singer/songwriter act to it's current evolution of full band, The Assembly Line has been turning heads since its inception. Their 2009 debut release, Grave...s Like Oceans, has garnered overwhelmingly positive reviews from publications such as AbsolutePunk - to having the song 'twenty-thousand leagues' make Music Under Fire's Top 100 Songs of 2009 List. Showcasing heart-on-sleeve honesty blended with memorable sweeping melodies, The Assembly Line were named Alternative Press' Top Unsigned Band of the Month in September 2009. With recent placement in MTV's hit shows 16 and Pregnant and Teen Mom 2 and additional television and film placement to follow, as well as big east coast shows opening for the likes of 100 Monkeys, Rookie of the Year, Allister, I Am The Avalanche, and Amber Pacific, The Assembly Line are poised to do big things.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">The Assembly Line</span> <a href=""http://www.reverbnation.com/theassemblyline"" target=""_blank"">official site </a>| <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/theassemblyline"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/theassemblyline"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/theassemblyline"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/theassemblyline"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/theassemblylinemusic"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p>",,,,,,,,,,,,2936,After Party In Lobby Bar: FunkMnkyz,,https://www.facebook.com/funkmnkyzDC?ref=ts&sk=wall,http://www.youtube.com/user/funkmnkyz,http://www.funkmnkyz.com/,16496,"<p>The FunkMnkyz hit the DC-area live scene and fell in love with playing loud and raucous shows without taking themselves too seriously.

Combining countless influences into a unified and original sound has helped define the band as innovators in an industry desperately lacking originality. No genre or sound is off-limits for the band; this is evident in their extensive list of influences that include Linkin Park, Skrillex, Nine Inch Nails, RedOne, and Lady Gaga. Rites of Ash is comprised of 80-two (vocals), Lazzo (guitars, keyboards, programming/sequencing), Tevey (drums), Toni (vocals), and Tuomas (keyboards).</p><p>Being an unsigned band hasn't hindered them from making their own professional music video (Burn) and getting it aired on Fuse TV, releasing four studio albums, and having their music featured on over ten MTV shows including: ""The Real World,"" ""Pimp My Ride,"" and ""Next."" Rites of Ash's live show is equally impressive, boasting choreographed lighting effects, custom-built stage pieces, and synchronized videos displayed on various flat-panel monitors.</p><p>Their music and live show have garnered them numerous accolades from the mainstream music industry; it has been described as ""unique but mainstream, hard-hitting yet romantically suave...truly cutting-edge song writing."" (S. Diablo, MTV)</p><p>The band has collaborated with Pablo Manzarek (son of Ray Manzarek of &lsquo;The Doors'), world-renowned DJs Idee and Paul Edge, photographer Doug Sonders, and mixing engineer Kevin ""131&Prime; Gutierrez on their previous releases (&lsquo;Epidemic of the Mannequins' and &lsquo;Like Venom').

Although it took till 2006 to find its final line up, even Rodgers would admit that he never imagined the legion of loyal listeners which has followed this eccentric quintet since he reconsidered that fateful day. By 2008 the loyalty of their fan base had already caught the attention of the Washington Post and Myspace (#1 folk-rock band in Virginia 2007), and their songwriting had already garnered them an honorable mention in the John Lennon Songwriting Competition. With the bands last release however, theScapes began racking up statistics and accolades.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">The DreamScapes Project</span> <a href=""http://thedreamscapesproject.com/index.cfm"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/dreamscapes"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thedreamscapesproject"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Dreamscapes-Project/7518860805"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fthe-dreamscapes-project%252Fid252378460%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mALU6pFITnE"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Virginia's premiere unsigned rock act; MADRONE combine intricate riffs, earth shaking drums, driving bass, and impassioned vocals to form a sound unlike any other.

This idea began to materialize with the two friends writing awful, acoustic, 3 Doors Down-esque songs that they recorded on garage band (for the record, those songs have since been deleted). But, it didn't matter how bad the songs were, they loved writing music and couldn't get enough. The two friends agreed that simply writing acoustic music wasn't cutting it anymore and decided to begin a band. So with the help of Falon Lewis (drums), Matt Oberdorfer (guitar), and Justin Pugrant (bass), Breaking Borders was formed. They released their debut album, This Crazy Weather, in September.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Breaking Borders</span> <span style=""color: #666666;""><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/breakingbordersmusic"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/#%21/breakingborders"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/breakingborders"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/breakingbordersmusic?sk=info"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fbreaking-borders%252Fid464160546%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/BreakingBordersMusic"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All net proceeds from the ticket sales will be donated to Music 4 More, a 501 (c) 3 charity that works to provide financial and in-kind resources to sustain and foster under-funded music programs in schools and communities across the United States.

These two habitually homeless singers have been crossing paths and untying tunes for years. With his experience matching her prodigal vitality, they float somewhere between folk and rocks and feathers. The haunting combination of their voices conjures forlorn yearnings of a past that never was and a future found at the song's end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trevor Garrod's career is somewhat of a mosaic, an artistic image of harmonious discord pieced together by fragmented bits of colorful textures. While spending more than a decade as the principal singer/songwriter and keyboardist for Tea Leaf Green, Garrod has been quietly establishing an impressive solo career. The effervescent, jagged jams rooted from a lifetime with Tea Leaf Green somehow fit beautifully among the smooth-edged, blue funk piano songs of his solo work. With each bit of distinctive difference haphazardly plotted, the sum of the parts illustrates all aspects of human life, through the eyes of one San Franciscan musician.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""color: #999999;"">Lael Neale</span> <a href=""http://www.laelneale.com/fr_home.cfm"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzC23KwgKpA&amp;feature=player_embedded"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Last Monarchs have seemingly arrived at the perfect time.

hit &ldquo;Monsters&rdquo; made it on a soundtrack for the beloved/hated vampire movies, but they aren&rsquo;t resting on those laurels.&nbsp; Fronted by Steve Shiltz, whom you may know as the singer/songwriter from New York band, Longwave, Hurricane Bells were named Alternative Press&rsquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Band You Need to Know in 2010.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their self-described sound is &ldquo;effortlessly catchy guitar pop packed with as many big hooks as beautiful, intimate moments capturing love, loss, redemption and - just like George Tilyou a century ago - second chances.&rdquo;</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;""> </span><em><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Hurricane Bells

With one foot in her Iowa home and one in Alabama where she grew up, she is a mercurial sort--a free-spirited beauty who is both self-possessed and disarmingly unaffected. Not easily categorized, her music is a unique blend of alt-country, folk, blues and indie-rock that speaks to music fans around the world and has garnered rave reviews from the likes of the BBC and Boston Globe, as well as a variety of hip music blogs and indie radio stations. She was recently featured on Amos Lee's new hit album Mission Bell along with Lucinda Williams and Willie Nelson and has toured with such diverse artists as Mark Knopfler, Ani Difranco, Calexico and John Prine.</p><p>She will be celebrating the release of her magnetic new album Mercury, featuring Mark Knopfler and a who's who of great studio talent. Saturated in her mercurial phrasing and mesmerizing melodies, this highly anticipated new release evokes the sounds of her native southland with raw folk and Americana songs that have strains of Gillian Welch and The Civil Wars with the radio-friendly allure of Feist and Ray Lamontagne.</p><p>Sometimes contemplative and other times brimming with energy, the album is infectious with country-esque numbers like ""Be With You"" and ""I'm Gone,"" evoking the spirit of Lucinda Williams' classic album Car Wheels on a Gravel Road. Making the record of her young career, Pieta shows her star isn't just on the rise; it's already here, shining bright for us all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Peyton Tochterman recorded his debut national release, A NEW WORLD.

Starting as a summer job playing on the streets of Old Town in Alexandria, the boys focused their many years of classically trained musicianship into a way to stay out of trouble while playing music for the public. The group has a wide range of sounds, ranging from old time fiddle music to modern indie folk. With major influences ranging from Johnny Cash to Old Crow Medicine Show, the trio finds a sound of old time bluegrass with the mix of a youthful twist. Consisting of fiddles, mandolins, guitars, and banjos, their is a clear sense of southern influence. Still seniors in high-school, these boys give their best.</p>",,,,,2874,Zach Swartz CD Release Party,,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Zach-Swartz/148994988522786?ref=ts,,,11141,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Jammin Java turns 10 this October!

Zach unlike most musicians doesn't care if he ""makes it"" he is a young talented rapper that is looking to have fun and put out a project for the kids that can relate to him to listen to!</p><p>The ""Accidentally Good"" album release party is going to be one of the hottest shows the DMV has ever seen. We have Footwork, the hottest up and coming band in the DMV. Zach spitting all of the best songs live off of his new album. We also have Henny and Lyricks closing out the show. Henny has opened for Wiz Khalifa, Mac Miller, Biz Markie and Chris Weby. Lyricks has toured all over the world with his music and is set to go on tour with Wu-Tang. This is not only going to be a great show, but all of the money raised is going back to the TMES non-profit organization to help other kids live their passioin!

A triple threat with her diverse songwriting, soulful vocals, and guitar goddess status - all featured on over twenty CDs, six of which are her releases - she has a pedigree in this business that's hard to match. A bit of a renegade, she likes to incorporate elements of Blues, Country, Swing, Zydeco, Surf, Gospel, Soul, and some nights, maybe even a Cumbia into the musical mix. Recent years have seen her stretching out musically working some expert whistling and scat singing into her shows. In addition to her trusty guitar, ""Patty,"" Carolyn has been regularly playing her trumpet, and even occasionally the accordion, mandolin, or keys...she is threatening to take up nose flute if someone doesn't stop her...</p><p>Wonderland's songs have been featured on NBC's ""Homicide,"" Fox's ""Time of Your Life,"" &amp; Houston NORML even made a video PSA set to Carolyn's ""Annie's Scarlet Letter."" She has toured with acts like Buddy Guy and Johnny Winter, sat-in with String Cheese Incident, Robert Earl Keen, and Los Lobos, and even sang the ""National Anthem"" at Sturgis Bike Week 2003. She's been lucky enough to jam with mentors and friends like Bob Dylan, Eddy Shaver and Ray Benson. She's co-written songs with Ruthie Foster, Cindy Cashdollar, Candye Kane and Guy Forsyth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If the depth in Hope Waits' soul-drenched voice suggests experience beyond her years, it's no accident.  Waits was born one of 12 children in a family plagued by poverty, neglect, her father's alcoholism and her mother's manic depression.  ""Basic needs were rarely met, and the abuse was astounding,"" she says.  ""But I love my family, and I would never want anyone to feel sorry for me.""  Waits found sanctuary in music, teaching herself how to write songs while hiding beneath her bed.  She made her escape at age 15, hopping on a Greyhound bus and traveling 700 miles to South Carolina where an older sister waited to take her in.</p><p>When Waits was 19 her mother was murdered by a still-unknown assailant, a tragedy that left her all the more determined to chase her long-held dream of a life in music.  ""I knew I would never find anything else to do in life that would bring that kind of fulfillment,"" she says.  Waits performed around the South before making the move to Los Angeles.  There she caught the attention of producer Peter Malick, who wound up manning the boards for her debut album.  But her troubles weren't over yet - Waits was diagnosed with a genetic hearing disorder that threatened to deafen her, a fact she kept to herself during the recording.  ""I felt that if people knew I was going deaf, I wouldn't be taken seriously as a musician,"" she says.</p><p>Two successful surgeries later, Waits' hearing is almost fully restored and she's ready to take on the world with her home-cooked stew of jazz, blues, soul and pop.  ""I know my mother would not be disappointed in me,"" she says.  ""Maybe she didn't make the best choices as a parent, but I am who I am because of her.  She gave me my voice.""</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Hope Waits</span> <a href=""http://hopewaits.com/newsblog/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/hopewaits"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/hopewaits"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://facebook.com/hopewaitsmusic"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fhope-waits%252Fid445728663%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">itunes </a>| <a href=""http://youtube.com/hopewaits"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/carolyn-wonderland/id7025180?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/CarolynWonderla,,2867,Vegas with Randolph (CD Release),,,,,0,,,,,,2865,Dean Fields,,,,,0,,,,,,2862,Miss Behave + Bella Bounce + Jungle Jessi,,,,,0,,,,,,2860,My Chikz Bad: Featuring Special Guest Mc Tali,http://www.myspace.com/mc_tali,,,,11329,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p><strong>Presented by B.M.C. / Life of Leisure / Digital Conspiracy &amp; LunchBox Entertainment</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LADIES 21+ GET IN FREE TIL 11<br />LADIES 18+ $10 TIL 11<br />GUYS - $15 Til 11</p><p>AFTER 11 its $20 for ALL!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>MC Tali is credited with being the most successful female MC in Drum and Bass of all time.

But a decade after their split, the group's core trio - singer/guitarist Steven Delopoulos, guitarist John Philippidis, and drummer Theodore Pagano - have reunited, returning with a beautiful, stripped-down new sound. ""We still have the energy, the focus, the drive,"" says Delopoulos. But as Philippidis explains, their musical tastes have matured: ""We went from being beer drinkers to red wine drinkers.""</p><p>Native New Yorkers Delopoulos and his cousin Philippidis have been playing music together their entire lives, and Burlap to Cashmere were born out of a theater project Delopoulos<br />performed in college. Pagano joined the group shortly after the cousins began gigging in coffee houses in the mid-'90s, and Burlap to Cashmere started to do what they did best - electrify live audiences. The band grew to a seven-piece ensemble and released a live EP, then an album called Anybody Out There on A&amp;M that showcased their unique blend of classic acoustic music, rollicking Greek rhythms, and flourishes of flamenco guitar.</p><p>When the record label changed hands, Burlap to Cashmere were nearly a casualty of industry politics. The band kept playing to rapturous audiences, but after six years at the top of their game, they called it quits out of exhaustion. Delopoulos recorded two solo albums and Philippidis carried on with session work, while Pagano worked as an interior designer (he's the guy who made sure Ikea showrooms and Apple stores look so appealing). All three thought about getting the band back together, but it took a traumatic event - Philippidis survived a near-fatal car accident and doctors had to reconstruct his entire face - to kick-start the reunion.</p><p>When the cousins played Pagano some of their newer tunes, he was blown away: ""It was Burlap again, but without all the '90s grandeur,"" he says. Jive Records agreed, giving the band a rare second shot. Earlier this year, the trio hit the studio in California with producer Mitchell Froom (Elvis Costello, Paul McCartney, Sheryl Crow) with a few simple rules: ""There would be no nudging, no Auto-Tuning, we're going into this for everything that's organic about the band,"" Philippidis says. The result, the eleven-track self-titled album, will be released on Jive and Provident Records.</p><p>""When I got out of the hospital, Steven and I just accidentally stumbled into the song &lsquo;Orchestrated Love Song,'"" Philippidis says.""It's really circusy, old-school, what we used to do<br />in the band,"" Delopoulos explains. But under the watchful eye of Froom, Burlap to Cashmere learned restraint. ""Mitchell's idea was to approach it in an orchestral way, so we're not playing a drum beat that sounds like Rush. It keeps the drama and strips back the dense instrumentation,"" says Pagano. The song still boasts rapidly changing time signatures that baffle even the most seasoned session player. But Burlap to Cashmere's ability to make the difficult sound simple has always been part of their magic.</p><p>""Divinity shines through dark places,"" Delopoulos says. ""Glancing at that divinity, to me is romantic."" ""Tonight"" - the oldest song on the disc - dates back 10 years. The joyous ""Santorini"" will transport you to the streets of Greece as Delopoulos sings about the pleasures of his homeland.</p><p>The centerpiece of the record is the gorgeous, Simon &amp; Garfunkel-esque ""Love Reclaims the Atmosphere."" ""It's about a dying patient,"" Delopoulos explains. ""I feel like we have an idea of what it's like to die, and we talk about peace and divinity and bliss, but what about the person actually going through that process? In darkness, there's light, and I think a lot of these songs go to those dark places so there can be an eruption of light."" It's a heavy topic, but on record, Burlap to Cashmere handle it with a delicate beauty, recalling their primary influences: Bob Dylan, Cat Stevens, Van Morrison. In the years between Burlap records, Philippidis became especially infatuated with Paul Simon's One Trick Pony.</p><p>""Steven sang this whole record, live,"" Philippidis says. ""There was not room for error. He had to get it or we threw the whole take away."" It's that incredible musical skill and the band's gift for mind-blowing live shows that promise to deliver Burlap to Cashmere back to their fans - and introduce them to a ton of new ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The new collection marks a quantum leap for the Los Angeles based solo artist, both in songwriting and in production. Nearly all of the songs from The Sky Below, Stargazer, and The Middle Way have been licensed for television - ABC's Brothers &amp; Sisters, Samantha Who?, Big Shots, and What About Brian?, ABC Family's Wildfire (4 times), CBS's Criminal Minds, Fox's Bones, WB's One Tree Hill, USA's White Collar, MTV's The Real World (4 times), Camped Out, and Laguna Beach, FX's Damages, numerous shows and movies for Nickelodeon, Lifetime's Movie of The Week, and many more - exposing Shane's songs to millions worldwide.</p><p>In addition to his own runs in North America, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, France, and Belgium, Shane Alexander opened a 19-date U.S. tour with Styx and Yes in the summer of 2011, opened SEAL's U.S. tour in 2008, and opened two U.S. tours with Jewel in 2007.

But life will catch up with you in time, as it did  for Rich Robinson. Before he was 25, he had fame as the guitar player  for the Black Crowes, fortune, a beautiful wife and home; seemingly, he  had it all. How he  managed to make it through with graciousness and his sense of  self-intact is examined on his new solo album, Through A Crooked Sun  (Circle Sound/Thirty Tigers- Release date: October 11, 2011).</p><p>To  refresh their individual energies, the band has gone on more frequent  hiatuses, which has allowed Rich to explore musical ideas that might not  fit the band dynamic, and also continue to hone his skills as a  terrific visual artist. Through A Crooked Sun finds the musical gifts that have propelled a  major career fully intact, but joined this time by a more sentient,  holistic outlook: that of a father, a son, a husband, a spiritual being,  a musician, fully integrated and more comfortable than ever in his  body, mind and soul.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On Dylan LeBlanc's debut album, Paupers Field, a lost world is brought to life - both in the carefully sculpted songs and rich well of country soul from which those songs emerge. Rough Trade is excited to have released Dylan's album on August 24th, 2010. Dylan's worn yearning voice already has the mark of aged experience. Neither the feel nor sound of the album, nor the haunted ghost summoning songs he has written, can be faked. Heritage springs up everywhere on Paupers Field.</p><p>His songs - ominously dark yet tenderly appraising emotions to find light and balm - don't just open up a world and his personal feelings and experience, they provide their creator with a valuable lifeline. He is not the sort of performer to shout about his arrival or proclaim his talent from the rooftops. Nonetheless, the seamlessly organic and selfproduced Paupers Field presents a fully formed total artist and this record speaks for itself. LeBlanc's is a voice from the present connected to the past, one sure to outlast passing trends and fads. Soul deep.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Dylan LeBlanc</span> <a href=""http://www.dylanleblanc.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/dleblancmusic"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/dylanstunesmusic"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/dylanleblancmusic"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fdylan-leblanc%252Fid372799526%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://youtu.be/dF5rEA-ccu4"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p>",,,http://twitter.com/richsrobinson,,2844,Ron Pope,,http://www.facebook.com/ronpopeofficial,http://www.youtube.com/ronpopemusic,http://www.ronpopemusic.com/fr_home.cfm,0,"<p>A musician's musician, Ron Pope can do it all: sing his heart  out, rip a guitar apart like his life depends on it, write a powerful  anthem or a heartbreaking ballad, and rock a crowd anytime, anywhere.  Pope has garnered critical acclaim the world over for his gorgeous and  unmistakable voice, electrifying stage presence, incredible songcraft,  and high octane, blues-rock fueled guitar fireworks that hit listeners  square in the gut.  Within a year of stepping out on his own, he'd sold  hundreds of thousands of singles and had offers from a number of major  labels. He eventually chose to sign with Universal Republic. After  finishing his successful tenure as a Universal Republic recording  artist, Pope decided that it was time to step out and shape the next  phase of his career on his own terms.</p><p>Pope received the benefit of nationwide television exposure as a  musical guest on MTV's TRL and through multiple placements on Fox's So  You Think You Can Dance. Following one such placement, two of his albums  exploded onto the iTunes top album chart at the same time. ""Whatever It  Takes"" combines rafter shaking, arena ready anthems, with ballads  exploring the depths of human emotion, and everything in between to  create something that is uniquely Ron Pope. Likened to artists as  diverse as Bruce Springsteen, Eric Clapton, and U2, Pope's musicality  allows him to satisfy listeners of all kinds.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fron-pope%252Fid281055424%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/ronpopemusic,"<iframe

you tapping your toes along to the beat of catchy tunes and nodding your head in understanding with subtly presented battle cries.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hailing from Canada, Roberts spins tunes like &ldquo;Without a Map&rdquo;, giving a peek into his ideology of &ldquo;musical exploration as a vehicle for emotional introspection&rdquo; that the band&rsquo;s latest album, <em>Collider</em>,

melody, Zeus has captivated rock fans around the world with Say Us, their full-length Arts &amp; Crafts debut, which won XM The Verge's Album of the Year award and was long-listed for Polaris Music Prize. Well known for their airtight live show, sugary harmonies and carefully crafted pop rock arrangements, Zeus is one of rock's rising elite. To satiate the band's constantly growing fan base, Zeus recently released the first two 7-inch singles in an open ended series.

He writes string quartets and musicals and pop songs, and his heart is fully in all of those endeavors. Equally at home as a performer as in the composing studio, Gabriel was hailed by the Los Angeles Times earlier this year for ""an all around dazzling performance"" in his debut at Walt Disney Concert Hall with the Los Angeles Philharmonic (in the premiere of his song cycle Orinoco Sketches, conducted by John Adams).  Performance highlights of last season included concerts with Chris Thile, Brad Mehldau, Alisa Weilerstein, and appearances at the Vail, Caramoor, and Aspen summer festivals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Leming wrote and began recording ""What You've Taken"" with Secondhand Serenade's John Vesely and Tom Breyfogle, who have proven their own independent success. The single brings Leming's history of lyrical reflexivity, aggressive chords and melodic vocals' directly to the frontline. Leming now handles his career entirely himself. He has a a viral Internet fan base. Leming made his debut on Season 7 of American Idol where he gained a hefty fan base and self-released and sold over 60,000 digital copies of old recordings on MySpace. Shortly after, he signed with Warner Bros. Records to record his debut album that took over two years to release. After releasing his debut album, Come On Kid, through Warner Bros.

Born in South Africa, and now a New Yorker, Dion got his start playing as a bassist in several bands on the Lower East Side music scene, and recently emerged as a solo artist. Dion has toured with high-profile acts like Tyler Hilton, Josiah Leming, Eve 6, Ryan Cabrera, The Donnas, Bleu, and Ben Kweller, while touring throughout the North-Eastern College circuit.  His debut album Gallery was released in 2009, followed by The Nearest Light (EP, June 2010) and his latest EP Welcome Home, released in April 2011.  On ""Welcome Home"", Dion worked closely with Steve Miller of Tyler Hilton's band and Tom Breyfogle of Secondhand Serenade.  The first single, ""Leave Me Out of This"" features Josiah Leming (American Idol) on piano.   His sophomore EP ""The Nearest Light"" was co-produced by Scott Reibling, known for his work with Weezer and Cobra Starship, and reached #8 on the iTunes singer-songwriter album charts.  Many of Dion's songs have been licensed for use on network TV including placements on MTV, E!, Oxygen, and Comedy Central. Dion has recently spent much of 2011 touring the U.S. with Josiah Leming and he spent Fall 2010 on tour in  Singapore followed by a 40-Date National U.S. Tour with Tyler Hilton.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Dion Roy</span> <a href=""http://dionroy.com/"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/dionroy"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/dionroymusic"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/dionroymusic"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fdion-roy%252Fid290071331%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/dionroy"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fgabriel-kahane%252Fid192279032%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/gabrielkahane,,2837,Mike Pinto,http://www.myspace.com/littledistrict,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Officially-Endorsed-Mike-Pinto-Page/57795258942,http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mike+pinto&aq=0,http://mikepintomusic.com/fr_home.cfm,11179,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Jammin Java turns 10 this October!

With the release of his debut album (Little District, 2005), Pinto began his attack on the Philadelphia music scene as a solo artist. By 2006, underground success and a rabid growing fanbase allowed him to expand westward with two nationwide solo acoustic tours.  The infectious sound garnered so much attention that Insomnia Radio added his single ""One More Time"" amidst a hard hitting compilation of the SoCal sound's brightest groups including DI and Slightly Stoopid, with the members of which Pinto often uses as his supporting band.</p><p>Pinto's music quickly traveled out of the continental States and can be found on Japanese compilations, on Hawaii's top radio stations by huge supporter and top radio personality Shaggy Jenkins as well as topping charts in Guam. As in Pinto fashion, the hype was followed up with tours where he sold out shows in Guam, Big Island, Maui and Oahu, creating even more buzz in the wakes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The reggae band, Jah Roots, was founded by Josh Heinrichs in 2001, along with four musician-friends from his hometown of Springfield, MO. Over the following eight years, they released five studio albums and toured extensively throughout the USA. During this time, Heinrichs wrote a number of songs that eventually gained fantastically large on-line &amp; word of mouth notoriety, and were downloaded en masse all over the world. The band's success was recognized in the official media outlets in Guam, Hawaii, Europe, USA, Japan &amp; South America. However, after years of playing to overflowing crowds at outdoor festivals and packed venues, the toll of non-stop touring &amp; other discrepancies began to take a personal toll, &amp; Heinirchs decided to step away from the band he had taken so far.</p><p>Aside from his new solo work, Heinrichs has also toured extensively with his friend, &amp; musical spar, Cas Haley(America's Got Talent Runner Up - 2nd Season). They have even recorded &lsquo;Favorites,' an as-yet-unreleased album of exciting new takes on their favorite classic &amp; modern reggae songs.</p><p>In July 2010, Heinrichs released the album ""Live in Hawaii"", which debuted at #41 on iTunes Top 200 selling reggae albums on July 2, 2010. In Sept. 2010, Josh released ""Josh Heinrichs &amp; Friends""(Sept. 28) to a #4 debut on USA iTunes Best Selling Reggae Albums. It also peaked at #8 on Amazon's Top 20 Best Selling Reggae Albums. For this album Josh had the fortune of working with a legendary &amp; international roster of artists to help build his first full solo album. The list includes members of Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers, Katchafire, Inna Vision, The Green, Clear Conscience, 77 Jefferson, Cas Haley &amp; more...</p><p>On May 17, 2011 ""Jah Roots"" was released internationally on GanJah Records. The acoustically driven album that   Heinrichs called ""A collection of his favorite songs from the albums he wrote while in the band, Jah Roots"" debuted as Amazon's #1 Hottest Selling Reggae Album &amp; at #6 on iTunes(USA) Top 200 Best Selling Reggae Albums.</p><p>""Emergency Spliff"" was released on Aug. 16th 2011. This was Josh's album with his former Jah Roots bandmate and deejay, SkillinJah. The album officially debuted at #16 on iTunes Best Selling Reggae Albums. The album was also chosen to be featured on the front page of iTunes Reggae as part of their ""New &amp; Noteworthy"" section.</p><p>Josh Heinrichs upcoming new solo album entitled ""Satisfied""has been announced to be released on Oct. 18th 2011.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Josh Heinrichs (formerly of Jah Roots)</span> <a href=""http://www.joshheinrichs.com/"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/joshuaheinrichs"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/JoshHeinrichsReggae"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fjosh-heinrichs%252Fid329592925%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/JahRootsOfficial"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dub City Renegades is a seven piece roots reggae band out of the DC area.

After raucous performances at Sonisphere, the Vans Warped Tour and a handful of U.S. festivals this summer, the Atlanta quintet will release their genre-obliterating new album III on October 18 via Tooth &amp; Nail Records//III Entertainment.</p><p>Coming off the high it got from the Warped dates, Family Force 5 decided to create its own label (Transparent Media Group), and release its next album, Dance Or Die, independently. The band's knowledge of its fanbase and close connection to the kids that bought over 350,000 digital singles and over 150,000 copies of their debut album created a strong brand that didn't need a major label behind it to succeed.</p><p>The band has continued to drop jaws, landing opportunities never before available to an artist operating from within: placing songs in major films (Almost Alice, Warrior's Way); winning countless awards by landslide amounts (Yahoo's Who's Next, MTVU's Freshman Class, AP Reader's Choice Awards, etc.); and scoring significant press in nearly every major outlet. Family Force 5 is working feverishly to complete its third full-length album, which is currently slated for release in the spring, and has been featured as one of Alternative Press's most anticipated albums of 2011.  Anyone familiar to their mythology knows, when Family Force 5 activates its collective booty-movin' powers, there's not a single rock club, dance floor or house party it cannot vanquish.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Getaways is a group Maryland-based rockers have  accomplished and achieved more than most local bands can say, with no  intention of slowing down. Up and down the Mid-Atlantic region, the band  has shared bills and directly supported noteworthy acts such as We The  Kings (S-Curve Records), Mayday Parade (Atlantic Records), Hawthorne  Heights( Wind-Up Records), Cash Cash (Univeral Republic) and Jeffree  Star (Popsicle Records), just to name a few.</p><p>Between the two releases, The Getaways have been featured in  Substream Magazine, on Baltimore's 98 Rock (97.9 FM) radio station, and  even signed a licensing deal with ESPN to have four songs off the first  record featured during the 2010 Lacrosse season. However, the band's  inclusion on the Maryland date of the 2010 Vans Warped Tour and the  opportunity to tour the East Coast late in the summer of 2010 with Just  Surrender (Razor &amp; Tie Records) only foreshadows things to come for  The Getaways in the future.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">The Getaways</span>&nbsp; <a href=""http://twitter.com/thegetaways"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thegetaways"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/thegetaways"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-getaways/id327197771?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/thegetawaystube"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Ffamily-force-5%252Fid121054708%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/familyforce5,,2832,"JAMMIN_��_��_ JAVA 10th ANNIVERSARY ""X PASS""",,,,,11394,"<p>Jammin' Java turns 10 this October!

Ryan Montbleau Band has been tending its own musical vineyard for a few years, on the patient cusp of a breakthrough. Their distinctive, long-fermenting blend of neo-folk, classic soul, and kick-out-the-jams Americana finally comes to full fruition in Heavy on the Vine. It's an album that represents the product of - and further promise of - a very good year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />Sister Sparrow &amp; The Dirty Birds is a nine-piece powerhouse that puts a modern spin on classic soul. The band is led by Arleigh Kincheloe (Sister Sparrow), whose astoundingly powerful voice and sly demeanor make for a spellbinding presence onstage. She is backed by the mighty force of The Dirty Birds, a flock of eight men who masterfully lay down thundering grooves and soaring melodies. While each of the Birds are capable of lighting up the stage with jaw-dropping displays of musicianship, it's clear they're focused on delivering the band's infectious music as a single entity. Simply put, the band's live show is explosive.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Sister Sparrow &amp; The Dirty Birds</span> <a href=""http://sistersparrow.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/sistersparrowdb"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://myspace.com/sistersparrowandthedirtybirds"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://facebook.com/SisterSparrow"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fsister-sparrow-dirty-birds%252Fid330233339%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8xW85JUy7A"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fryan-montbleau-band%252Fid195172948%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/#!/RyanMontbleau,,2822,Tyler Ramsey (of Band of Horses),http://www.myspace.com/tylerramseymusic,http://www.facebook.com/tylerramseymusic,http://youtu.be/OV4jmffjv2I,http://www.tylerramsey.com/,11368,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Jammin Java turns 10 this October!

Friend and bandmate Bill Reynolds (who's worked with The Avett Brothers and Lissie) produced and aided on bass, while friend Seth Kauffman (Floating Action) sat in on drums and guitar, also singing background vocals.  Over a rare snowy set of six days in the southern city, Ramsey crafted nine, finely spun songs, keeping the focus on performance as they were played, and letting fresh ideas reveal themselves as they would.  The sessions were intense; the three musicians separated and insulated from most normal daily goings-on during the recording period. The result: a crystalline yet warm album, filled with Ramsey's rich, plaintive vocals and expressive, intricate guitar playing.</p><p>Ramsey is perhaps most immediately recognizable as the tall, lean guitarist in Band Of Horses, having played with them since 2007, starting before the release of their breakthrough album, Cease To Begin. A well-established and praised guitar player and singer in the burgeoning music scene of Asheville, NC where he calls home, he first learned to play music on piano before moving to the guitar. Ramsey grew up listening to and studying country-blues guitar players like Mance Lipscomb and Mississippi John Hurt, and American finger pickers like John Fahey and Leo Kottke,absorbing their sound and making it all his own.  <br /> <br />Ramsey released his self-titled debut in 2004 and followed it in 2008 with A Long Dream About Swimming Across The Sea (Echo Mountain Records), which was praised by NPR (World Caf&eacute; - ""Heartwarming, delicate, and comforting""), Stereogum (&lsquo;Artist To Watch'), WNYC's Soundcheck, and Popmatters, among others.  That album - a ollection of haunting and atmospheric songs that exude a markedly fluid, easy grace - was re-released by Brown Records/Fat Possum in January 2011.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />If you crossed Ray Lamontagne's voice with Damien Rice's lyrical intensity, you have Luke Mitchem...</p><p>You will often find Luke in a charcoal vest, slightly kept beard, displaying a quiet intensity. It's the sweet calm before the emotional storm. The passion and immediacy behind Luke's music is evident in his 3 independent releases since February 2009. Emotional and poetic lyrics about the inspirations in his life are sewn together throughout his songs. This steady flow of genuine music has increased his visibility and earned him comparisons to such notable acts as Ryan Adams, Joe Purdy, Damien Rice and Ray Lamontagne. Luke's captive live shows open the listener's heart and soul to a voice familiar but unique. There is a passion behind Luke's songs that have to be witnessed in person. In just a year of live performances, Luke has sold out shows under his belt, performed with David Dondero, Butterfly Boucher, David Mead and Rachel Loy and released his highly anticipated 3rd album, ""Love, Laura and the Bomb"".</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Luke Mitchem</span> <a href=""http://www.lukemitchem.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.lukemitchem.com/"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/lukemitchem"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/lukemitchemmusic"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fluke-mitchem%252Fid305529988%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/lukemitchemmusic"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/tyler-ramsey/id268407364?uo=4&partnerId=30,,,,2819,The Getaway Car + West Goes East (Mark and Justin Jonasay),,,,,0,,,,,,2817,Hey Marseilles,http://www.myspace.com/heymarseilles,http://www.facebook.com/heymarseilles,http://youtu.be/zvYuiJVkc5g,http://www.heymarseilles.com/,11670,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""></span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""><br /></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2008, three guys embark on a musical adventure instigated by one's first melody on his brand-new used accordion. And, some months later, seven guys-the original trio plus a few old friends-get together in a garage in Seattle and record an album. To Travels and Trunks is both Hey Marseilles' mission statement and its hazy dream put to music.</p><p>The Hey Marseilles sound is immediate, evocative, mostly acoustic, always emotive. It's classically-trained brothers Sam and Jacob Anderson on cello and viola, their strings grand and mournful on To Travels and Trunks' sweeping title track. It's the wheeze and moan of Philip Kobernik's accordion, simultaneously the gawkiest and most romantic of all instruments, opening the gorgeous ""From a Terrace,"" and his kid-at-a-carnival Rhodes on the 6/8 spin of ""Gasworks."" It's Nick Ward's electric guitar on the epic ""Calabasas,"" stretching into the distance like an open road. It's the Dixieland swagger of Patrick Brannon's trumpet on uptempo lead single ""Rio""-recently Song of the Day at NPR, Spinner.com, and KEXP. It's a songwriter's urgent expression via vocalist Matt Bishop, expanded with huge singalong choruses, unraveled by a virtuoso band's sinuous arrangements. It's modern vintage, a folk-pop jam session at a vanished cabaret on the Seine, an indie rocker's fantasy of his grandparents' first kiss.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Lumineers have ""floored people with their ability to engage infamously stationary crowds."" - Jen Kelley of Band in Boston Podcast</p><p>Winner of the ""Best Surrounding Area Band"" in the 2009 HMA's (Hoboken Music Awards)</p><p>""Honest and unadorned orchestral folk"" with an EP that is ""top-to-bottom, full of wisdom."" - Kiernan Maletsky of Westword</p><p>""Disarmingly simple, sincere music that's as raggedy and ramshackle as it is heartfelt and human"" - Eric Eyl - The Denver Post</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">The Lumineers</span> <a href=""http://www.thelumineers.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/thelumineers"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thelumineers"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/TheLumineers"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-lumineers/id350720227?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://youtu.be/AmZJUfcxrvc"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/hey-marseilles/id300112116?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/#!/heymarseilles,,2812,HoneyHoney,http://myspace.com/honeyhoneyband,http://listn.to/honeyhoney,http://youtube.com/user/HoneyHoneyBand,http://honeyhoneyband.com/,11657,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Early show!

How Suzanne Santo (vocals/banjo/violin) and Ben Jaffe (vocals/guitar) managed to reconcile not just polemics, but seemingly opposed realities for their sexually tinged, bruised knee honeysuckle take on roots music has to be heard to be understood.</p><p>Yet somehow the young 20-somethings figured out that it's the extremes that define the middle, whether embracing the big mistakes in the bluesy smoulder ""Glad I Done What I Did,"" embracing the romantic doubt that is the low slung gospel of ""Don't Know How,"" or the euphoric romp-age of ""Let's Get Wrecked"" that embraces the arc debauchery completely. This is the sound of coming not of age, but awareness; and digging into what it means to be alive permeates throughout honeyhoney's October 24th release of Billy Jack on Lost Highway Records.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Joshua James has been writing and singing songs for only six short years, but the 25-year-old heartland poet has the perspective of a wise, old soul. Possessing a whispery and intimate vocal style that works its way into the ear peacefully and directly, Joshua James is pitched midway between seminal influences like Bob Dylan and Neil Young.  His debut was the #1 Folk Album on iTunes, and ""FM Radio"" amassed more than 150,000 downloads as part of an iTunes promotion.</p><p>In addition to performances at Sundance, SXSW and CMJ, James has toured with John Mayer, David Gray and Ani DiFranco, winning legions of fans along the way.

Lydia has risen to fame quickly as the band won a nationwide competition to be part of Atticus Draggin' the Lake Volume 3 compilation hosted by the Atticus Clothing with the song ""Smile, You've Won,"" in 2005. It continued its success with its demo, ""Your Taste is My Attention,"" making it to the Volume 4 in 2006.</p><p>The band (then Leighton, Steve, Ethan, Evan and Mindy White) released their sophomore album ""Illuminate"" to extremely positive reviews and gained a great following. The band released their (at the time) final album, Assailants on July 20, 2010. They followed it up with the Goodbye &amp; Farewell Tour in both the United States and Australia.</p><p>After a year long hiatus, Leighton and Craig have decided to write, record, and released a brand new album under the Lydia name in the summer of 2011.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Formed in 2007, Ocean Is Theory is a proven indie success story. Their self released EP Into the Mouths of Lions helped the band become a favorite amongst the local Atlanta scene and throughout the Southeast, and allowed them to gain credibility and exposure. While touring, they sold over 6,000 copies of the EP independently and soon caught the attention of retailers who brought the EP on board. At the same time, the band continued to write new material and released their second EP, In My Blood Again, in 2009. In My Blood Again was produced by Matt Malpass (Copeland, Lydia, Relient K) and mixed by producer Mike Sapone (Brand New, Taking Back Sunday).Based out of Atlanta, GA.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Ocean Is Theory</span> <a href=""http://oceanistheory.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/oceanistheory"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/oceanistheory"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/oceanistheory"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Focean-is-theory%252Fid275743049%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/oceanistheory"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Forever questing for innovation, SPEAK invoke timeless melodies in energetic, synth-laden anthems.

Coming strong off the release of their second LP ""Memento Mori"" these fun-loving, beach-rocking all-stars are showing no signs of slowing down.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Trenchtown</span> <a href=""http://trenchtownmusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/trenchtownusa"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/maryzeyez"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/trenchtownusa"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Ftrenchtown%252Fid387764167%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/trenchtownusa"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Idleminds are a 4 piece skate punk band from souther md.

Compared by some to Kings of Leon, the band performed at the 2008 ~SXSW festival and released its Rotten Apples EP on the Retone label that same year. In 2011, the band self-released Timing is Everything. LA Times Magazine's June 2010 ""Music Issue"" recently picked Voxhaul Broadcast as one of LA's &lsquo;Best New Indie Bands' by ultimate tastemaker Nic Harcourt. Voxhaul Broadcast has showcased at SXSW, CMJ, Sundance, Noisepop Pop Fest in San Francisco, been featured on DAYTROTTER (w/ a second session booked for later this summer)and won the title of &lsquo;Best Indie Band' at Milwaukee's Summerfest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />After touring the globe and enjoying some of the greatest times of their lives, John Taylor (vocals/guitar), Ryan Liestman (Keys/Backing Vocals), Greg Garbowsky (bass/backing vocals), Jack Lawless (drums) decided it was time to start their own project, one that would see them develop a truly unique rock n' roll sound - Ocean Grove.</p><p>After recording 14 songs in two weeks, Ocean Grove finally felt they had come into their own. The EP, Another Place to Stay, mixed by Paul Hager (Van Halen, Goo Goo Dolls, American Hi-Fi) and mastered by renowned recording studio, Sterling Sound (Adele, Green Day) is an EP filled with feel good songs pulling from their greatest influences such as The Beach Boys, Tom Petty, and Weezer. The inspiration for the EP came from years of experiences and all the little things life throws our way.</p><p>Ocean Grove might be a new band, but don't let them fool you- they've created successes long-time bands only dream of achieving. The band shows no signs of slowing down. And their accolades don't stop in the studio- playing with acts such as Stevie Wonder, Brad Paisley and Vince Gill, performing on over 50 television shows, and having played two sold out shows at the Troubadour in Los Angeles and the Gramercy Theatre in New York City- the first two shows ever played as Ocean Grove.&nbsp; While being proud of all their past accomplishments, Ocean Grove is ready to continue something truly special and all their own.  With their EP, and positive outlook on all that's to come, they are ready for just about anything.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Ocean Grove</span> <a href=""http://www.oceangroveband.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/oceangroveband"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/oceangroveband"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/ocean-grove/id419982669?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/oceangroveband"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Robert Coppola Schwartzman (born December 24, 1982) is an American actor and musician.

TheRuinCity prides themselves in creating music with a unique upbeat style and sound, influenced by bands such as Augustana, Copeland, Switchfoot and The Fray. The band was founded in 2010 by frontman and piano player Mike Daknis, along with lead and rhythm guitar players Josh and David Hoppel. The band later added drummer Dill on Knighton, and bass player Kyle O'Keefe. TheRuinCity debuted with their critically acclaimed self-titled EP on September 4th, 2011, and quickly caught the attention of the local music scene. The band's love of music, each other, and just having a good time, results in an inspired live performance, characterized by their energy and passion. In their first few months of performing, they have sold out multiple headlining shows in the DC area. Their single, ""What I Mean To You"", has been selected to play on all Delta airlines flights this spring. The band is determined to use their music for a purpose greater than themselves, and this vision led them to donate all of the proceeds from their EP to a non-profit organization called Love 146 to help prevent child trafficking, and help rehabilitate survivors.</p><p>Primed to be the next big thing out of Northern Virginia, TheRuinCity is hard at work playing shows around the DC area, writing new music, and preparing for their 2012 sophmore release.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Ftheruincity%252Fid462349660%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/#!/theruincity,,2778,An Evening With The Duhks,http://www.myspace.com/theduhks,http://www.facebook.com/theduhks?ref=s,http://www.youtube.com/user/tduhk,http://www.duhks.com,11098,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Jammin Java turns 10 this October!

This isn't surprising, given its blend of soul, gospel, North American folk, Brazilian samba, old-time country string-band music, zydeco and Irish dance music, and the attack it brings to these interwoven acoustic styles. The Duhks' unique sound has also earned the band a Grammy nomination, one Juno Award, two additional Juno nominations, two Folk Alliance awards and an Americana Music Association nomination for Best Emerging Artists.</p><p>""The inventive Canadians in The Duhks are widely beloved for their smooth blend of traditional roots music, bluegrass and soul, which they inject with well-placed Afro-Cuban and Celtic influences."" -NPR</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-duhks/id18241597?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/theduhks,,2774,SONORUS II (A Wizard Rock Festival),,,,,10610,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wizards and muggles will unite once again to rock out in at SONORUS, a day-long music festival for Harry Potter fans who like to rock.

They travel without a backup band, and on their first full-length album, Barton Hollow, the bare-bones live arrangements that fans hear on the road are fleshed out with just the barest of acoustic accoutrements. Each song is an intimate conversation, and no third wheels or dinner-party chatter are going to interrupt that gorgeous, haunting hush.</p><p>On the other hand, there's been something distinctly loud about the duo's introduction to the world, even prior to the album's release. Their signature song ""Poison &amp; Wine"" was heard on Grey's Anatomy-in the foreground, in its entirety, over a key climactic montage, prompting hundreds of thousands of viewers to Google the mystery music. And they got a wholly unsolicited endorsement when America's biggest pop star gave The Civil Wars a seal of approval. After first tweeting her love for the duo, fellow Nashvillian Taylor Swift included ""Poison &amp; Wine"" as a selection in her official iTunes playlist, saying, ""I think this is my favorite duet. It's exquisite.""</p><p>When ""Poison &amp; Wine"" was heard in its entirety on Grey's Anatomy-versus in the background, for a few seconds, as Williams and White had expected-they knew that if the show's audience liked what they heard, it would put their search skills to the test. The title only pops up in a verse, not the chorus, so it involved some ingenuity or intuition to track the tune down. Fortunately, viewers proved up to the test of finding, and choosing, their ""Poison."" At last count, the song's official YouTube video had been viewed 400,000 times.</p><p>There's something circuitously satisfying about the fact that ""active listening"" is taking place on-stage at The Civil Wars shows as well as among the audience, heightening the sensation that it's a conversation being eavesdropped on, not just a performance. So much synchronization to go around... but also so much delicious tension, as the duo hardly shy away from the conflict that gives them their moniker. Harmonious discord, thy name is The Civil Wars.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>""Barton Hollow may be a fictional location, but The Civil Wars' music gives it a voice and identity-one of mystery, mystique and beauty.

After 410 miles, much soul searching and bonding, they decided to tell their story to the world in song. The four friends Vintz, Jacob, Scoops, &amp; Tyler together forged a rustic sound with story-telling songs that are reminiscent at times of Springsteen or Dylan. Of their sound, River James' singer Vince Scheuerman says, ""We would like to keep it organic, with acoustic guitar or piano in each song. And the idea is to run the gamut of dynamics, from the whisper of one man and his guitar, to the full band hitting you with everything they have.""</p><p>Their debut EP was released on May 24, 2011. The band recorded and self-produced the four tracks of the EP in a tiny studio in Chesapeake, VA, a stone's throw away from it's namesake, the James River. The songs were recorded live with the goal of producing something that sounded personal and honest. The opening lyric of 'Avenue A' says ""These days, oh it's tough to get by"", kicking off a discussion that ranges from addiction to shattered dreams, and then to finding the beauty of love in tragic circumstances. And the songs maintain a hopeful tilt, as the EP ends with the lyric from 'Dreams' - ""I pray we not forget our dreams"".</p><p>If you have not heard of River James until now, you may have heard of some of its members. Since mid-2010, this new band is the brain-child of singer Vince Scheuerman, formerly of Army Of Me (Atlantic/Doghouse Records) and drummer Jacob Marshall, formerly of MAE (Capitol, Tooth &amp; Nail Records). The two longtime friends met when their former bands toured together several years ago. They have found synergy and camaraderie with their collaboration, along with bass player John ""Scoops"" Hutchins, and guitarist Tyler Strickland, which takes them in this new direction.</p><p>River James is fresh on the heels of residencies in New York City, Washington DC, Nashville, and Atlanta, and a tour with Jack's Mannequin. And they're only just getting started.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Songwriter and musician Mike Mangione, along with his band The Union, embark on a new tour that will cover a lot of ground this year.  Mangione has remained an independent touring artist for over seven years. Tenebrae, as the album was named, was released twice, once in 2007 just before the band embarked on a new tour, and then a second time after it was picked up for national distribution in 2008. All the while the band played non-stop on the road, often moving in oddly shaped orbits and crisscross patterns around the country.</p><p>In the years since its release, Tenebrae has outshined Mangione's debut in both the sophistication of its sound palate and its bottom line sales. The band has sold over 10,000 units of Tenebrae alone, all without any label or major management support. Equally notable, the album has been licensed by MTV, VH1, Lifetime and Oxygen networks, GMR Marketing, real estate websites, religious websites and podcasts, independent films, and is used by internationally renowned author and speaker Christopher West at his speaking presentations. The band has played over 250 shows in the time since its release, from coast to coast, including a tour of Australia.</p><p>Following the success of Tenebrae, measured on the scale of an independent release, Mangione and band decided that a new album became not only possible, but justified as well. The release also compelled Mangione's touring band to settle finally on a fitting band name, and as such, The Union was born.   Mike Mangione &amp; The Union will release their latest effort, Offering, in a newly signed development deal between Dualtone Records and their own imprint, RODZINKA Records in 2011.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Mike Mangione &amp; The Union</span> <a href=""http://mikemangione.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/mikemangione"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/mikemangione"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=27806214869"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/offering/id436467090?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/mikemangione"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/river-james/id414965953?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/riverjamesmusic,,2764,Special Guests,,,,,0,,,,,,2763,The Only CD Release,http://www.myspace.com/thebandonly,http://www.facebook.com/#!/thebandonly?sk=app_178091127385,,,10781,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />THE ONLY... the coolest new sound in Pop/Rock. 2010 saw DC area singer/songwriter/rock keyboardist Gabe White team up with guitarist Nate Dellinger, bassist Christian Mikkelsen and drummer Bobby Spencer to form THE ONLY. With killer hooks and heartfelt lyrics, THE ONLY emerged as one of the freshest sounds in pop/rock. Their first concert was winning the GMU battle of the bands - one week later they opened for national recording stars ""Plain White Tees"". They never looked back.</p><p>White's venerable keyboard talent is reminiscent of 70's-rock-giants-meets-contemporary-pop-feel, while he superbly handles front man duties. Dellinger's guitar sounds are a great mix of rock history creating very lush and crisp voicings. Bassist Mikkelsen sets the grove and never wavers except to lay down some really kicking turnarounds. Spencer melds it all together on drums and THE ONLY puts out a huge sound complimenting their part brit-rock/ameri-pop style. The songs are awesome on CD - and even better live.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With an exciting and high-energy live atmosphere, Tom Lohrmann brings   the rockier side out of the traditionally mellow Singer/Songwriter   genre. Drawing from multiple genres, including Pop Punk, Soft Rock, and   Alternative Rock, Tom Lohrmann creates a unique take on a familiar,   likable sound. With a debut EP now out on iTunes, and a forthcoming EP   on Thanksgiving of 2011, Tom Lohrmann aims to win over new fans with his   flowing chord progressions and catchy lyrics.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Tom Lohrmann Band</span> <a href=""http://tomlohrmann.bandcamp.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/promnightfight"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/tomlohrmann"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/tomlohrmann"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/tom-lohrmann/id391377892?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/tomlohrmann"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p>",,,,,2760,Bobbie Allen,http://www.myspace.com/bobbieallenmusic,http://www.facebook.com/BobbieAllenMusic,http://www.youtube.com/user/BobbieAllenMusic,http://bobbieallenmusic.com/,10812,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Early show!</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Allen describes her journey in to music as serendipitous but destined. While constantly moving homes to accommodate her family's duties, Allen always kept her tape deck playing, and sang to herself in the backseat of the car. All those road trips in the car created a sound that has been described as Cat Power fused with Norah Jones.

Currently, ranked as the 26th Most Popular Musician on YouTube with over 920,000+ subscribers, Tyler releases one new video each week. Combining original music, covers, and showcasing featured artists, Tyler's passion is to connect with people through music..</p><p>Tyler's realization of becoming a successful national artist arose when he first started playing with national acts such as The Fray, The Jonas Brothers, Gavin DeGraw, Augustana and Ryan Cabrera. ""After that first big show with The Fray, I was sold on doing music for the rest of my life,"" says Tyler. Playing shows for thousands of people fueled Tyler's drive and creativity.</p><p>In February of 2010 Tyler decided to cover the massive hit ""We Are The World"" during the Winter 2010 Olympics. In the first week Tyler received 1.5 million views, and his career changed forever. Now with over 270,000,000+ views, Tyler has broken into mainstream music, and the charts. Tyler was the first independent musician to be charted on Billboard's SOCIAL 50, and has maintained status for 40+ weeks. Rubbing shoulders with the likes of Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Justin Bieber, and Rihanna, Tyler has been ranked as high as #14 in the world and currently holds the #4 position on Billboard Uncharted (ranked over 50 weeks), and connects with over 540,000+ fans on his Facebook page. <br /> <br />In 2010 Tyler also expanded his desire to work with other artists. With the inception of Tyler Ward Records and Tyler Ward Studios, Tyler is giving other artists a chance to be heard by hundreds of thousands of people every day all over the world.</p><p>In late 2012, Tyler will begin his second world tour in Europe and North America.</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/tyler-ward/id266414855?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/tylerwardmusic ,"<iframe

Performing alongside Corinne on a series of CD release shows for her own record &lsquo;The Promise', Kelly Joe realized that he'd met a true musical partner, and she the same. By the end of their second show together they decided to forge their respective solo careers into a powerhouse duo.</p><p>The fundamental layer of Corinne and Kelly Joe's new partnership is mutual admiration and respect both for the ideal of honest, inspired, poignant art, and each other's own creativity and musical vision. They also share a ravenous passion for the acoustic guitar. From this foundation these two are creating beautiful, exceptional music. Intricate and lush harmony vocals wrap themselves around layers of interlacing, weaving guitar parts.</p><p>Corinne and Kelly Joe's first duo record &lsquo;MagneticSkyline' - recorded at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch - was released in October 2010 on British indie label &lsquo;Tin Angel Records'. This release has received wide European acclaim, including 4 star reviews from the BBC and the well-respected music publications &lsquo;Q' and &lsquo;Uncut'. 2011 will see them in the studio to record their second duo release and touring extensively, with three European tours already slated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Corinne West</strong>, a fourth generation Californian and musician who performs upwards of 200 shows each year, has a voice that simply soars. Using her powerfully eloquent voice, coupled with beautifully crafted songs - memorable both lyrically and melodically - she has fashioned a unique identity within American music's acoustic/roots scene. Her latest record, 'The Promise', confirms West's place among the finest young singer-songwriters. Described as ""elegant new sexy acoustic jazz-rock-folk"", and ""west coast acoustic soul music"", this is a work of deep feeling and deep inspiration, roads traveled and roads less traveled, songs insightful and resonant about matters of the heart, soul and existence. In concert, Corinne brings a special grace and fire to the stage. Her songwriting strength coupled with magnetic stage presence create a captivating performance, winning rave reviews at home and abroad. Corinne has toured extensively throughout the US, Canada, Europe and the U.K., and has been featured on national radio in these regions.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Corrine West</span> <a href=""http://www.corinnewest.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/corinnewest"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/search/?q=corinne+west#/MizzWezt?ref=search&amp;sid=764823509.2312585745..1&amp;__a=1 "" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/corinne-west/id210430133?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/CorinneWest"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kelly Joe Phelps</strong> has, over the course of eight CD's and fifteen years of touring the world, established himself as a guitarist, singer, and songwriter with singular vision and fearless purpose.

He's recorded with Townes Van Zandt, Greg Brown, Martin Simpson, Jay Farrar, and a host of others.

Though her career has primarily focused on musical theater, Sarah's first love has always been pop &amp; rock.  ""Goin' Back"" is an exploration of the music that made Sarah want to sing and gave her the passion to perform.   With new takes on old classics by Dusty Springfield, Heart, Journey, Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears and even Barry Manilow, Sarah will make you remember why you love music. When Sarah Jebian sings, you can't help but be taken in by her magnificent sound. The colors in her voice are so rich and nuanced, and her heart pours through her music in a way that captivates you from the first note. Sarah makes you feel like the long trail of cigarette smoke in a jazz club when she sings lustful low notes, she lifts you out of your seat when she delivers her high notes and she can sell a song like Liza Minnelli - she has it all. Warmth, raw emotion, a soothing kiss and passion... A true vocal treasure, that is Sarah Jebian.

What began as an opening act for Rusted Root shows, Michael's solo tunes are beginning a new life completely independent from the successful jam band.</p><p>More intimate and appealing to an even larger audience. Michael's writing is evolving like the living project that it is. In order to more clearly identify his solo endeavors, he has separated from his moniker with Rusted Root and taken the name Michael Ki.

New Englanders  Bronze Radio Return have done just that on their sophomore album, the  gorgeous and varied SHAKE! SHAKE! SHAKE!. Contained within the space  between notes and breaths are thousands of miles, and decades of  history.</p><p>With an arsenal of song sketches in hand, Bronze Radio Return set to  work to flesh out each of these songs. Formed in 2008, Bronze Radio  Return's line-up took a few years to solidify, though most of the band's  members were orbiting each other for years at the Hartt School, one of  the country's best schools of music, located in Hartford, Connecticut.  For debut Old Time Speaker, the band relocated to Nashville for a  two-week period, to, as Henderson puts it ""a place we'd never been with a  producer we'd never met, and played a bunch of songs we'd never played  before."" For such an inauspicious set of circumstances, the band managed  a solid and well-received debut, and forged a lasting bond with  producer Chad Copelin. Old Time Speaker established the band's  relentless touring schedule, including an invitation to represent the  Connecticut music scene by performing for President Obama at an event in  Bridgeport, CT in 2010. Fan favorites ""Digital Love"" and ""Lo-Fi"" have  been picked up for advertising and television licensing and the album  landed on CMJ's Top 200 Album Chart.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Bronze Radio Return</span> <a href=""http://www.bronzeradioreturn.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/bronzeradio"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/bronzeradioreturn"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Bronze-Radio-Return/25326931728"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/bronze-radio-return/id276554600?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/bronzeradioreturn"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p style=""margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"">&nbsp;</p><p>Many artists struggle to establish their musical identity, laboriously trying on different musical styles like items of clothing, looking to find what fits. But there are others that emerge fully formed, in full command of their craft, their identity and their music. Tim Brantley fits squarely in the latter category. Friends were so impressed with what they heard that they chipped in to help Tim buy a microphone and mixing console so he could begin recording in earnest. The result was an exciting blend of pop and rock that channels musical influences like Hall &amp; Oates, Wilco, and Fleetwood Mac while defining a distinctive style all its own.</p><p>The warmth and timelessness of Tim's own songs resonated with listeners, and pretty soon he was playing bigger shows for bigger audiences in and around Atlanta. In 2009, indie label Blackledge Records released his self-produced debut album, Goldtop Heights, a commanding and infectious mix of 70's pop rock, Atlanta grit, and Brantley-style wistfulness. From the very opening notes of the album's first single ""Damage,"" one can immediately hear that combination of melodic irresistibly and lyrical incisiveness that are becoming the musician's hallmarks.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Tim Brantley</span> <a href=""http://www.timbrantley.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/TimBrantley"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/timbrantley"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/timbrantleymusic"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/tim-brantley/id34623010?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://youtu.be/2eIsVtJzj_4"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chuck grew up in the low country of South Carolina.

After seeing them perform, there is no denying that they are not a typical trio. Coach Cotton is the ring-leader, frequently immersed in a sea of knee-high concert goers. Wearing a wireless head-set microphone, he wades through the mass of dancing children, dispersing high-fives and shaking a tambourine. Williebob provides the necessary string work for the show, moving among a collection of guitars, mandolins, and banjos while wearing a kazoo around his neck. Boogie Woogie Bennie is a one-man-band within the power trio, employing a contraption that one four-year-old fan described as ""the piano-drum"". The piano-drum allows Boogie Bennie to play the bass drum with his right foot, the snare drum and hi-hat cymbal with his left foot, and the keyboard with his hands (with his left hand playing the bass parts). Together, Rocknoceros is able to cover a dizzying range of musical styles in each set. From Tin Pan Alley to the shores of Jamaica, Rocknoceros hops from genre to genre like a toad on summer asphalt.</p><p>Having already released three award-winning records, Rocknoceros will be releasing their first kid-friendly concept album, ""Colonel Purple Turtle"". The new album tells tales of the Colonel and his friends in their make-believe home of Soggy Bog. The theme of ""Colonel Purple Turtle"" is one of friendship and working together, a subject that matters to Coach, Boogie Woogie Bennie, and Williebob, as the three members of Rockncoeros have been best friends since they were children. The record reflects their abiding trust in each other, and their desire to share the message of camaraderie through song.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/rocknoceros/id258825234?uo=4&partnerId=30,,,,2716,River City Extension,http://www.myspace.com/rivercityextension,http://www.facebook.com/rivercityextension,http://www.rivercityextension.com/video,http://www.rivercityextension.com/,11147,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Late show!</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""> </span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>River City Extension was formed by singer-songwriter Joe Michelini in the fall of 2007.  The band has proved to be an important addition to the development of independent folk music, and has earned the respect of everyone from seasoned punk rockers to Brit-pop legends.</p><p>After spending years building an invaluable local following as a solo artist, Joe's moniker became a symbol of hope for musicians in his hometown of Toms River, NJ; like lost souls, the members of River City Extension were drawn to each other. Taking a year and a half to carefully finalize their line-up, the band went into the studio to record their DIY EP, Nautical Sabbatical. The record was self-released on January 1st of 2009, and they had no other option than to hit the road.</p><p>The band had started to record their full-length album The Unmistakable Man, with no budget, no plan, and a lot of faith. As word began to spread, they found themselves supporting bands like Cake, Robert Randolph, and The Avett Brothers, in and out of their home state. Near the end of production, the band signed a deal with XOXO Records (The Gaslight Anthem, Let Me Run), and shortly there after blasted the press with what would be the new flagship of this venerable Asbury Park punk label. The Unmistakable Man was released on May 11th, 2010 with national distribution and international promise. RCE quickly garnered the attention of important music outlets such as Paste, Spin, and NPR, as well as being validated by timeless international performers such as Glenn Tilbrook of the band Squeeze, who would later make a cameo on the vinyl release of the bands first LP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mokey Doris is an indie rock band based out of Washington, DC. They coalesced in the summer of 2010 as a four piece composed of Robert Mays, Cody Jones, Michael Pion and Kalem Jones. Their influences range from Nirvana and My Bloody Valentine, to Elliott Smith and of Montreal. Mokey Doris has played multiple venues in northern Virginia and Washington, DC, honing their craft for the past year and a half. They are currently working on their self-titled debut album which will be out this fall. Until then however, the best way to experience them is to go to one of their shows and hear this four piece for yourself. Mokey Doris's hope is that their sound will fill your minds with pirate incense, that it may dispel any foul odor and seduce the underwhelmed among you.</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/river-city-extension/id305048693?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/rvrctyext,,2714,The Supervillains,http://www.myspace.com/therealsupervillains ,http://www.facebook.com/thesupervillains,http://www.youtube.com/user/therealsupervillains ,http://blog.thesupervillains.com/,11248,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p><br />For almost a decade, the Supervillains have continued their fortuitous rise up the ranks of the musical totem pole and are now able to stake their claim as one of the nation's biggest names in the reggae and ska genres.  Furious instrumental solos and keyboard melodies compliment the combo's penchant for formulating unique arrangements, drawing from a wide range of obvious influences. Their set-list keeps the listener on their feet as the band bounces around from up-tempo ska, roots reggae, rock hooks, and shout-along choruses with subject matter that pretty much covers the bases: women and partying.<br /> <br />Casting a wide net, their musical versatility has opened the door to over a dozen assorted fully-national tours with some of the nation's most distinguished acts. They have supported reggae tours (The Wailers, Inner Circle), reggae-rock tours (Slightly Stoopid, Pepper), ska tours (Reel Big Fish, Streetlight Manifesto), punk tours (Pennywise, Authority Zero), rock legends (Fishbone, English Beat), major festivals (Wakarusa, Earthday Birthday), and have twice been on the east-coast leg of the Jagermeister MusicTour.

Enter the Philadelphia quartet known as The Movement.</p><p>The prominent new additions to the group proved their worth immediately as the live music took on a potency it had never achieved with a looped beat. The band's dedication to touring virtually nonstop since the release of Set Sail has served to establish their increasing reputation as an unmissable live show. As a further result, Set Sail has thus far attained the number 7 spot on iTunes' Top 100 Reggae Albums, brushing shoulders with the releases of long-established icons of the genre.

TIMELORD was formed in January 2005 by guitarist Aaron Richert and guitarist/vocalist Matt Aub. Drummer extraordinaire Rick Hodes and bass prodigy Joe Konczal stepped in commandingly to fill the unoccupied rhythm section. The band immediately began assembling the very best heavy-metal compositions they could create. Intros, outros, verses, etc. were revised to perfection. The resulting songs were recorded and compiled into an incredibly impressive debut album entitled ""Regeneration."" Between 2005 and 2009, TIMELORD opened for Gamma Ray,The Marc Rizzo Band, Edguy and Primal Fear. The band also played at local shows in Virginia,Maryland and New Jersey. In November 2008,TIMELORD performed at the Keep It True XI Festival in Wuerzburg,Germany. Other bands on the bill were: Flotsam &amp; Jetsam,Artillery,Girlschool,Tokyo Blade and Nasty Savage. In August 2010,original bassist Joe Konczal resigned from the band. Kyle Augustine has since taken over the bass guitar duties. MUSIC ANALYSIS: TIMELORD's compositions are sonically dense, filled with dark minor keys and heavily orchestrated rhythm guitar work. The band's multi-faceted etudes leave listeners entranced- never knowing what lies behind the next cymbal crash. The abundant use of melodic chorus sections adds a strong European elegance to TIMELORD's aggressive speed-metal sound. In addition- tempo and meter changes inflect progressive concepts into the ensemble's commanding aural assault. As expected- all instruments are performed with razor-sharp surgical precision. Intelligent composition and songwriting, soaring vocal melodies, intricate water-tight rhythms, blazing guitar solos, rock-solid bass work and highly precise drumming are the core elements that form the grandiose resonance emanating from the dark domain of the TIMELORD.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><span style=""color: #888888;"">TIMELORD</span>&nbsp;   	<a href=""http://www.myspace.com/timelordband"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/TimeLord/186980471327114 ""> facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/timelord/id286278590?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30 "">itunes</a>&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><strong>A Sound of Thunder</strong> is a Washington DC based, female fronted heavy metal band.

A Sound of Thunder conquers metal realms ranging from '70s blues-based proto-metal a la Black Sabbath and early Judas Priest, to triumphant modern power metal a la Hammerfall and Primal Fear. Soaring vocals, incendiary instrumentals, and classic songs combine to form an unrelenting, unapologetic slab of metal to stand the test of time.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">A Sound of Thunder <a href=""http://www.asoundofthunderband.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/duchessodork"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/asoundofthunderband"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/A-Sound-of-Thunder/300792816337"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/a-sound-of-thunder/id355902617?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a></p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/iris-divine/id314599937?uo=4&partnerId=30,,,,2709,Nikki Jean,http://www.myspace.com/nikkijean,http://www.facebook.com/nikkijeanproject,http://www.youtube.com/nikkijeanproject ,http://nikkijeanmusic.com/,10504,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.<br /><br /></span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""><br /></span></p><p><br />Nikki Jean contributed lyrics and an unforgettable vocal to ""Hip Hop Saved My Life,"" a 2008 smash hit (and successful viral video) from Lupe Fiasco's The Cool, a #1 rap album that peaked at #14 on the Billboard 200. From April through August 2008, Nikki Jean performed on the Glow In The Dark Tour which included Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, Rihanna and N.E.R.D.</p><p>Nikki Jean has been reaching out to her fans through the internet via her MySpace page (where she's enjoyed more than 700,000 profile views) and her YouTube channel, the Nikki Jean Project, which has garnered more than 2.7 million total video views. Since launching her channel, Nikki Jean has been YouTube's Most Viewed Musician of the Day, Most Viewed Musician of the Week, and a Most Viewed Musician of the Month.</p><p>Nikki Jean would travel cross-country, working on songs with collaborators who would top any list of the greatest songwriters of all time. The plan was inspired, but also wild and improbable. Who could imagine that a new artist, still in her early 20s, could reach out to a wish list of Hall of Fame songwriters, and that so many would say yes?</p><p>What emerged is a compact musical history: the girl group sound, Motown, classic pop, Philly Soul, a place where country literally meets hip-hop. The challenge was to take these diverse influences, this geographical and musical range, and make it flow. &lsquo;PENNIES IN A JAR' accomplishes this beautifully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Opening for Nikki Jean is New York's Alex Miller, an up-and-coming lyricist who projects something smooth,  breathy and real.  ""I've been told my lyrics sound like some sort of amalgam of Jason Mraz, Dave Matthews, and Elliot Smith.""  Miller's lyrics reveal an astute sensitivity to each move in the ""chess"" of relationships.  He imagines the full range of players, from pawn to king, at one moment with foreboding, trepidation, disquietude, and at the next, amusement, humor or absurdity.  Miller's sound, deep and unique, stretches across a variety of instrumental influences from Phish to Queens of the Stone Age to John Mayer.</p><p>He came out with this first CD, ""Off Season,"" to a crowd of summer acquaintances in 2004.  A growing audience encouraged him to invest in a major recording ""Just a Dream"" released a year ago, complete with a successful Canal Room CD release performance (in New York City) in August 2010.  This past May, a group of investors supported his working on a third CD, tentatively titled ""Two Sides of a Coin,"" to be released in late fall.</p><p>Yet, through it all, says Miller: ""As much fun as it is to be a singer/songwriter, I still prefer the energy of a crowd.""  A consummate performer, he meets each audience member where they are and wakes them to their own rich journey through his sometimes gentle, sometimes futile, always honest story telling.  Since moving to New York two years ago, he has played at a number of venues including The Canal Room, The Knitting Factory, Rockwood Music Hall, National Underground, and his regular spot--Prohibition. This summer, he has been touring from Massachusetts through Texas to California and then back the northern route.  Miller is eager to gain a fan base and get his songs heard ""the old fashion way""- by performing them.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Alex Miller</span> <a href=""http://www.alexmilleraudio.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/AlexSMiller"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/alexmilleraudio "" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Alex-Miller/100334416698036"" target=""_blank"">facebook </a>| <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/alex-miller/id427373222?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a></p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/nikki-jean/id446039485?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://www.twitter.com/nikkijean,,2707,VMG x City Of Dreams presents: YONAS,,http://www.facebook.com/YonasMusic,http://www.youtube.com/user/YonasTV,http://yonasmusic.com/,10418,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Late show!</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />Straight from the boogie-down Bronx, meet YONAS - and meet the future of Hip-Hop.

After seeing Will Dailey in concert, the New York Post's Dan Aquilante favorably contrasted him with the performers on American Idol, writing, ""Forget the last five months of force-fed artificial pop music on TV that just crowned a king (who I'm betting will be forgotten as quickly as he was created) - Will Dailey is the real deal.""</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Will Dailey and his band The Rivals will help raise awareness for Farm Aid's mission to keep family farmers on their land in order to guarantee an agricultural system that ensures farmers a fair living, strengthens our communities, protects our natural resources and delivers good food to all.

Along the way, they sold more than 15,000 copies of their self-released EP's, recorded by Seth, who had earned a degree in record engineering. 2006 saw the release of the band's major label debut, Daylight, and a relentless, national touring schedule. Despite being on the road nearly non-stop, NEEDTOBREATHE returned the following year with The Heat, which went to #2 on the Heatseekers chart and spawned the hit single ""More Time,"" a top 10 success at Triple-A radio (sitting alongside established artists like Coldplay and Jack Johnson). The group's penchant for capturing a poignant moment or eliciting an emotion with their music is evidenced by the numerous songs from each of their albums that have appeared in film and television, including the Hilary Swank-starring, motion picture P.S. I Love You and MTV's ""The Hills,"" among many others.</p><p>And it is truly magic when the four members of NEEDTOBREATHE take the stage. The band has honed their live show the old-fashioned way - putting in the time, spending years on the road. Aside from their skillful musicianship, there's a spontaneous energy that intangibly connects them with their audience, and their powerful performances have helped build a dedicated fan base that's been clamoring for The Outsiders.</p><p>Without a doubt, NEEDTOBREATHE are extremely proud of The Outsiders and can't wait to see what will unfold for the band next. ""This band is our life - it's everything, really the only thing, that we've done for the last 10 years,"" Bear continues, explaining that the band literally poured everything they had into The Outsiders. ""We know this is the best record we've ever made.""</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/needtobreathe/id113247214?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/needtobreathe,,2701,Marque & Reprisal,,,,,10325,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>Please note that advance tickets for this show cannot be purchased  through Jammin' Java.

He is perhaps best known for his 2010 song ""You Always Make Me Smile"" (co-written with friend Neil Mason) which was featured in a worldwide Holiday Inn ad. The music video for the song was filmed in Utah during an attempt to break the Guinness World Record for the largest water balloon fight  and went viral.  His interactive video for ""Sushi"" (directed by Dennis Liu) was made from 1.4 million tiles, and thousands of unique YouTube video stills. In 2010 it was shortlisted for the Guggenheim's YouTube Play Exhibit.</p><p>His music has been used in numerous TV shows and commercials, including a worldwide television ad for Dell and a national television ad for Doritos (""Bombs Away"").  ""You Always Make Me Smile"" also appeared in an episode of ABC's Grey's Anatomy. Although Kyle performs as a first-name/last-name artist, and self-recorded the majority of his discography, he plays live with a full band. He has received critical attention from NPR,as well as AOL Spinner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Influenced by some of the legendary names of pop and soul, such as the Beatles, Elton John, Otis Redding, and Stevie Wonder, Californian Ernie Halter first began to make waves for himself with the release of his 2005 collection, Lo-Fidelity. Eventually, word of mouth and the Internet community on websites such as MySpace and YouTube worked in Halter's favor. <br /> <br />Halter's subsequent releases, Starting Over (2008) debuted on the iTunes Rock Album Charts at #22, Ernie Halter Live (2009) debuted on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter Album Charts at #9, and the latest release Franklin &amp; Vermont (2010) debuted on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter Album Charts at #2. Ernie Halter's 4U (2010), a free and exclusive sampler, quickly became the #1 Mp3 Album download on Amazon.com. Ernie's online fanbase has grown to 10,000+ YouTube subscribers and nearly 500,000 followers on social networking site Twitter. Halter has shared the studio and stage with pop icons such as: Neil Young, Jason Mraz, Colbie Caillat, Sara Barielles, Katy Perry, Christina Aguilera, Hanson, Eric Hutchinson, Drake Bell, Sister Hazel, Shooter Jennings, Corrine May, and Lady Antebellum. His songs have been heard on General Hospital, Cougar Town, Army Wives, MTV's The Real World, Disney's Sonny With A Chance, and more.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Ernie Halter</span> <a href=""http://www.erniehalter.com/fr_newstours.cfm"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/erniehalter"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/erniehalter"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/erniehaltermusic"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/ernie-halter/id439658997?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/erniehalter"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""><br /></span><a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/taxicab-racers/id402001704?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank""></a></p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/kyle-andrews/id7447664?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://www.twitter.com/thekyleandrews,,2691,Andy Davis,http://www.myspace.com/andydavis,http://www.facebook.com/andydavismusic?ref=ts,http://www.youtube.com/andydavis,http://www.andydavisonline.com/,10270,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p><br />Andy Davis's smart and seductive blue-eyed soul music weds indelible hooks to sly, incisive lyrics, creating songs that sound like newly minted pop-soul classics.</p><p>A Louisiana native, Davis released his first album, ""Thinks of Her,"" in 2004. ""Thinks of Her"" struck a chord on college campuses, selling out its initial print run. In 2005, the remastered rerelease of ""Thinks of Her"" gained Davis national exposure and brought him to the attention of legendary music producer Mitchell Froom (Paul McCartney, Sheryl Crow, Elvis Costello).  Davis toured extensively in support of ""Let the Woman"", both headlining and opening for Colbie Caliat, Jakob Dylan, Mat Kearney, Will Hoge, Howie Day, and NEEDTOBREATHE. The following year, Davis became a prominent member of Ten Out of Tenn, a critically acclaimed collective of Nashville singer/songwriters who joined forces for a collaborative tour that was documented in the award-winning documentary film, ""Any Day Now.""

But a wake-up call is long overdue, and this is it. All of which makes Pardon Me the perfect introduction to one of the most electrifying young bands in America _� or at least the next best thing to experiencing Jonathan Tyler and the Northern Lights live. Literally.</p><p>But when they signed to Atlantic's F-Stop Music in late 2008, Tyler wanted to do more than just bottle that thunder and lightning on disc for the band's major-label debut.  He wanted to make sure that the songs maintained that close to the bone integrity that spawned the whole wild ride in the first place. The core lineup of lead singer, guitarist Jonathan Tyler, guitarist Brandon Pinckard, drummer Jordan Cain and bassist Nick Jay may have only made its public debut at the dawn of 2007, but the ensuing three years have been a blur of full_�tilt rock 'n' roll showmanship worthy of prime James Brown and the early Rolling Stones or the E Street Band at their hungriest.</p><p>The inspired addition of singer Mo Brown to the fold early on pushes the sass and swagger needle into the red, with a supporting cast of horn and organ players on deck when whim or venue calls for even more firepower. But no matter how many people are onstage, the exhilarating energy is the same. And that goes for whether the band's playing it in front of a few dozen strangers in a bar, a few hundred diehard fans in a packed club or arena crowds in the thousands while opening for heavyweights like AC/DC, Kid Rock, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Deep Purple and even fellow Dallas maverick Erykah Badu.</p><p>And so it begins. The story of Jonathan Tyler &amp; The Northern Lights has yet to be written, but it is sure to be a page_�turner and one_�hell_�of_�a wild ride.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Happen-Ins performance has all the ingredients necessary to satisfy the hungriest of spectators, as they are treated to a smorgasbord of passion and energy matched only by the feast of danceable rythms and ear bending guitarwork the band puts forth.

""They keep us honest, expecting good music both on the road and on the albums,"" mentions frontman Keith Roberts. _��_��The inspiration for Real World, the group's third record on Higher Octave, is drawn from the trials and tribulations of being a real, working band and their life on the road. ""We are all aware of how lucky we are to be making a living by doing what we love.&nbsp; Building a fervent fan base comparable to that of jam band rockers like Phish and Dave Matthews Band, The Young Dubliners have become notorious for the whirling ""jig pits"" that erupt at their live shows.</p><p>In fact, the group's origins can be traced back to Los Angeles' vibrant pub scene in which Dublin natives Keith Roberts (vocals, guitar) and Paul O'Toole first met. Roberts was composing some Irish ballads at the time and thought a band might be in the offing. Assembling a rag-tag team of Irish transplants and like-minded American rockers, The Young Dubliners grew into a pugnacious music machine resulting in their debut, the Rocky Road EP (1994). It exhibited a hefty rock sound that made them a club favorite. Breathe followed a year later with the addition of Chas Waltz (violin, keys, harmonica, etc). _��_��By 2000, the band had morphed into a septet without O'Toole and released the critically acclaimed Red. The presence of the band sky-rocketed: Gabriel Byrne requested the band to write the theme song for his television show Madigan Men and they spent much of 2001 touring Europe with Jethro Tull, and the US as headliners and as openers for acts such as John Hiatt and Robert Cray.</p><p>The Young Dubliners also revved up the crowd at the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. That same year, the band scaled back down to a five-piece - Roberts, Brendan Holmes (Bass), the returning Waltz (who had left the band in 1995), Bob Boulding (guitar) and David Ingraham (drums) - and released Absolutely. _��_��After going on a number of headlining and co-headlining US tours (Johnny Lang, Collective Soul, Great Big Sea and others), the quintet settled down to record Real World - an album influenced by their predecessors (Waterboys/Pogues/U2/Big Country) and most importantly, life on the road.</p><p>From Irish-flavored anthemic rock to rowdy pub tunes, lead singer Keith Roberts voice is stronger than ever and the songwriting, performance, and production show a new maturity and artistic ambition.&nbsp; _��_��Musing about the band's sound, Roberts sums up the Young Dubliner's approach to their music, be it Celtic, Irish, or just plain rock. ""I like to think that our take on songwriting and performance makes the Young Dubliner's sound unique and original. Our band is made up of Irish and American natives who draw influences from just about everywhere. Our strength is in the sum of our parts. We play as a band, as one.""</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-young-dubliners/id652472?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/youngdubliners,,2685,Deep River Summer Revival with Special Guest Larkin Poe,http://www.myspace.com/deeprivermusicva,http://www.facebook.com/deeprivermusic,http://www.youtube.com/user/deeprivermusic,http://deeprivermusic.com/,10487,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span><em><br /><br /></em></p><p><strong>Special REUNION fan club launch package deal - become a member of The Reunion and get all of this:</strong></p><p>- Pre-show cocktail hour in the green room with the band AND ""Deep   River Water"" provided (a delicious and refreshing beverage designed by   one of our fans).

We are songwriters. We are music lovers.</p><p>We're still on the search for stories, and striving to learn how to tell them well. Now, we not only hound bookshelves, but also the people surrounding us. We search for stories of human experience, of love won and love lost, and of the million mundane things that make up everyday life. Larkin Poe: the name of our great-great-great-grandfather; a man who survives in the memories and hearts of succeeding generations; a legend, a tall tale, a truly everlasting story. Just the thing that we hope to become.</p><p>Our musical journey, which began for us as children playing classical violin and piano at the ages of 5 and 6, continued through our teenage years as we toured internationally from 2005 to 2010 as The Lovell Sisters. This incarnation, which included our eldest sister, Jessica, took us from the stage of the Grand Ole Opry to wonderful summer festivals such as Bonnaroo and Telluride, and even gave us the opportunity to collaborate with the likes of Elvis Costello. In January 2010, after saying &lsquo;farewell' to The Lovell Sisters, the musical story of our young adulthood has begun in the form of our new band, Larkin Poe.</p><p>Joined by Knoxville-based musicians, Daniel Kimbro (bass), Chad Melton (drums), and Mike Seal (electric guitar), Larkin Poe released its debut EP, Spring, on February 17, 2010. We decided to embark upon the quest of recording and releasing four seasonally themed EPs in 2010: Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter.</p><p>Already this year we've gotten to do some amazing things - from playing on the Cayamo Cruise, to going on tour opening for Brandi Carlile and the Indigo Girls; we've played at Merlefest, toured for over a month in Europe, and can hardly wait to see what the rest of this year will bring.

The serendipitous meeting between the two (Kenneth Pattengale &amp; Joey Ryan) led quickly to a shelving of the solo careers each had been pursuing. While neither had been compelled to such collaboration with any of his peers before, an effortless musical complement, fast personal fondness, and like-minded view toward how to present the collaboration to their fans influenced the duo's formation and, almost immediately, began drawing praise from varied sources.

In 2009, he played a major role in Quite Like Me, an independently released album by vocalist Dionyza, and he provided background vocals on Usher's Raymond V. Raymond, issued the following year. He finally broke through as a solo artist in 2011 with The Budding Rose, an EP led by the stunning ballad ""'Til the End of Time,"" a duet with Veronika Bozeman promoted with an equally striking video.

Better Said Than Done, and listen to stories about stupid things other people have done and lived to regret. Storytelling can be defined, simply, as the art of telling a story, but that is open to a lot of interpretation.  Better Said Than Done defines storytelling as the art of performing a true, personal story in front of a live audience.  Our stories are personal.  And they are stories, meaning they have a beginning, middle, and end.  Most importantly, storytelling is a performance, an art, a form of entertainment, and, from our mouths, a reality the audience will not forget. Our performers have appeared at venues throughout the area, including Chief Ike's Mambo Room, Franklin Park Arts Center, and Town Danceboutique, and have participated in the Capital Fringe Festival, DC SWAN Day, TEDx, Mortified, SpeakeasyDC, Story League, and Fan-Freaking-Tastic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,http://twitter.com/BetterSaidDone,"<iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/4AROL07_noE"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",2664,Rubblebucket,,http://www.facebook.com/rubblebucket/,http://www.youtube.com/user/Rubblebucket,http://www.rubblebucket.com/,10118,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/rubblebucket/id436209090?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://www.twitter.com/rubblebucket/,,2469,Marcy Playground,http://www.myspace.com/officialmarcy ,http://www.facebook.com/officialmarcyplayground,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KT-r2vHeMM,http://www.marcyplayground.com/,9864,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Early Show!</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On their riveting and keenly-anticipated fourth album, Leaving Wonderland... in a fit of rage, Marcy Playground return to action in triumphant fashion. Armed with songs born of an intense and turbulent period in his life, MP's main man, singer/guitarist John Wozniak, has fashioned a record that digs deep, taking the listener on an exhilarating and satisfying emotional and musical rollercoaster ride. Its creator is justifiably proud of his accomplishment, calling it ""by far the best thing I've ever done. This is the most personal record I've ever made, and I think it's the thing that will connect most with other people.""</p><p>A highly original and melodic modern rock band, Marcy Playground exploded onto the scene back in 1997 with the insanely irresistible hit single ""Sex And Candy,"" a song that notched [a then-record] fifteen consecutive weeks at number one on Billboard's U.S. Modern Rock tracks chart... and a self-titled debut album that went on to sell 1.7 million copies. Subsequent albums Shapeshifter (1999) and Marcy Playground 3 (""MP3"") (2004), while commercially obscure by comparison, showcased two periods of tremendous creative evolution for the group, and have gone on to enjoy something of ""cult classic"" status among the band's many loyal fans.</p><p>Over the last 10 years, Wozniak has spent a lot of time in the recording studio, on the other side of the microphones, honing his production skills. As owner and operator of famed Vancouver recording studio &lsquo;Mushroom' from 1999 to 2006, Wozniak recorded and produced Marcy's third album ""MP3"", as well as albums by the likes of Canadian rock bands Stabilo, (including the hit ""Everybody""), and The Weekend's ""Beatbox My Heartbeat."" During those years Mushroom also witnessed the birth of hit records from the likes of Mudhoney, Matthew Good, Tegan and Sara, Sam Roberts, Hot Hot Heat, as well as Daniel Powter's multi-platinum self-titled debut album on Warner Bros., produced by Mitchell Froom and Vancouver producer Jeff Dawson. It was Jeff Dawson's work at Mushroom, on Powter's pre-production sessions, which initially attracted Wozniak's ear, and eventually led to a collaboration on Leaving Wonderland... in a fit of rage. Powter himself contributes a fluent piano track to one of Leaving Wonderland&lsquo;s stand-out songs, ""Gin And Money"", while such notable Vancouver studio players as Darren Paris, Niko Friesen, Simon Kendall, Mark Wilde and Dave Pickell are also featured.</p><p>""I think Jeff is largely responsible for why all these songs work together the way they do"" says Wozniak. ""Having him in the studio allowed me to focus on the creative elements of the songs, the nuances and the performances, and leave most of the production details up to him. We had a difference of opinion here and there, but it resulted in us putting our heads together to come up with something even better than either of us would have come up with alone. It really helped to have that extra brain and set of ears in the studio.""</p><p>Dawson's technical prowess and the work of mastering maestro Bob Ludwig ensure Leaving Wonderland... maintains a polished sonic consistency while demonstrating a huge dynamic sweep in the style of its material. Eclecticism has always been a Marcy Playground signature, to the point that Wozniak admits that ""I honestly don't know how to describe my music. We don't have a specific genre, so I just call it all rock n roll.""</p><p>The diversity of the Marcy Playground style can perhaps be partially attributed to the nomadic life of its founder. Born in St. Paul, Minnesota, John Wozniak attended Marcy Open School (the inspiration for his band's name). At age 9, his family moved to Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania where, years later, he would record his first solo album, Zog Bogbean-From The Marcy Playground in his bedroom, before spending his college years in the early 90's in Olympia, Washington. By 1996, record label interest in his work lured him to New York City where he formed Marcy Playground with bass player Dylan Keefe. Stints in Pennsylvania, Vancouver and Toronto have followed, so this is clearly a man who knows something about ""leaving wonderland,"" or, in his own words, ""the myth of new beginnings.""</p><p>The sense of a spiritual quest, a personal emotional journey, is evocatively explored on Leaving Wonderland. The haunting and sparse ""Irene"" and ""Memphis"" possess an intimate and rootsy feel light years away from the aggressive sound of tunes like ""Gin And Money,"" ""I Burned The Bed,"" and ""Emperor,"" numbers Wozniak laughingly calls ""our big rock songs."" His open-hearted and unaffected vocal style shines on the gently affecting ballads ""Good Times,"" ""Thank You"" (""you are the reason I'm the man you see today""), and ""Blackbird,"" a tender homage to his wife, while the catchy and light-hearted feel of ""Star Baby"" screams out for radio play.</p><p>The fact that Marcy Playground have always operated outside the musical fashion of the day has helped give their songs a timeless feel. Their material has been featured on such soundtracks as Cruel Intentions, Simply Irresistible, Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back (the 2004 MP single ""Deadly Handsome Man"") and, most recently, Zack And Miri Make A Porno. For the latter film, the now classic ""Sex And Candy"" proved a perfect choice.</p><p>With the release of Leaving Wonderland. Marcy Playground are itching to get back on the road to both reconnect with their loyal audience and attract new fans. Joining Wozniak and bassist Dylan Keefe is new drummer, Shlomi Lavie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/marcy-playground/id633000?uo=4&partnerId=30,,https://twitter.com/BlizzardOfWoz,,2466,Where's My Face 2:,,,,,8956,,,,,,2464,Jared Evan,http://www.myspace.com/jaredevanmusic,http://www.facebook.com/pages/JARED-EVAN/61860534972,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ext5BuTERRA,http://www.jaredevan.com/,8953,"<p>JARED EVAN grew up playing the drums, hoping for the chance to one day become the next Keith Moon. However, with his introduction into the world of Hip Hop during his early teen years he could not help but have his musical aspirations redirected. JARED's early years were filled with difficult personal issues and Hip Hop provided a fresh outlet as well as a new layer to his musical taste. JARED became heavily influenced by older seminal Hip Hop artists such as the Wu Tang Clan, Mos Def, The Roots, Kool G Rap, Tribe, KRS One, Pete Rock, Dj Premier and others. JARED soon began to fuse his new passion with his old. Taking musical cues from his rock influences such as Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Radiohead, Sublime, The Who and others.</p><p>JARED began to produce, sing and rhyme over new genre blending beats while introducing heavily melodic hooks to create classic sounding songs with groundbreaking undertones. Soon, others began to take notice. In 2008 at the age of 19, Jared won the Brooklyn Hip Hop Festival's Spit 16 competition curated by The Source Magazine. JARED was invited to open the festival and his performance immediately caught the attention of attendees, MC's and the press. Matt Graham (now his manager) formally of The FADER magazine and now owner of BRND MGMT was one of those attendees. Off of the strength of his performance, JARED was invited to perform several shows including an opening gig for Lupe Fiasco in the fall of 2008.</p><p>At that point JARED returned to the studio to begin to hone his sound and complete his mixtape entitled ""Radio In My Head"". Upon completion of the first draft of the mixtape, Graham put it in the hands of his friend and Hip Hop superstar director, Rik Cordero. Rik said this about Jared after hearing the mixtape ""JARED meshes Hip Hop lyrics, electronic and post punk influences with classic rock to create a truly unique sound."" Rik and JARED immediately began to create visually stunning music videos to compliment Jared's provocative sound. These videos were then circulated to the top music executives and within weeks JARED had several major label offers.</p><p>In June of 2009, JARED decided to sign with Zone 4/Interscope. With the support of industry giants like Jimmy Iovine, Polow Da Don, Rik Cordero, Steve-O, Matt Graham and Jimmy Douglass, it appears that at only 20 years old, JARED EVAN will undoubtedly be one of 2010's most talked about artists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,2462,Daniel Amos,http://www.myspace.com/danielamosmusic,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Daniel-Amos/31781975896,,http://www.danielamos.com/,9553,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />Daniel Amos began as an acoustic quartet formed by Terry Scott Taylor, Steve Baxter, Jerry Chamberlain and Marty Dieckmeyer.

Musically, the album includes the guitar driven rockers; the heart wrenching balads; the thought provoking lyrics; and the innovative studio techniques and production that the band has become known for for so many years. A DVD was released in 2005, entitled The Making of Mr. Buechner's Dream, which chronicles the recording process.</p><p>Although concert performances are rare, Daniel Amos continues to be one of the most creative, innovative and influential rock'n roll bands of the last few decades.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/daniel-amos/id259030536?uo=4&partnerId=30,,,,2460,Claudio Rivera (Saves The Day),,,,,0,,,,,,2459,Claudia Rivera (Saves The Day),,,,,0,,,,,,2457,An Evening with Matt Nathanson,http://www.myspace.com/mattnathanson,http://www.facebook.com/mattnathanson,http://www.youtube.com/user/mattnathansonmusic ,http://mattnathanson.com/,9433,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>""Charged by lyrics that linger long on your brain, Nathanson's sweet, carefully chosen and honest reflections are combined with memorable melodies."" - American Songwriter</p><p>After relocating from Boston to San Francisco in the early '90s, Nathanson came to prominence on the coffeehouse scene, but before he picked up his acoustic guitar, he was well-schooled in the art of big-riff rock.

The name Secondhand Serenade allows him to be free to do whatever he feels like, from a solo performance to ten musicians on stage at once.</p><p>Secondhand Serenade took off like John couldn't believe - the crowd at live shows and an ever increasing online presence (not least his MySpace page, with a massive 140,000+ friends) prompted him to release his debut album, Awake.</p><p>Perfectionist that he is, the studio was top of the range, and John produced the entire ten tracks himself.

Another notable player of this technique is Stanley Jordan, an American jazz/fusion guitarist.</p><p>Balawan developed the same progression with Stanley Jordan, that he is able to produce a piano, bass and guitar at the same time using just one instrument. Usually Balawan uses all four fingers of his right hand to create the melody progressions and his left hand to create the bass and rhythmic sounds.</p><p>Another unique thing is that there is no pattern or repetition whatsoever between the left and right hand.

With no plans of pursuing music professionally, Nathan stumbled into songwriting more as catharsis than ambition. What started as a hobby after college quickly turned into a passion, one which he soon felt necessary to share with an audience. His first two projects Through Playing Me (2006) and These &lsquo;Ol Keys (2009) reveal a soulful disposition and a natural affinity for provocative songwriting.</p><p>Coupled with an incessant touring schedule and attention paid to the ever-changing landscape of social media, Nathan has managed to sell over 15,000 albums independently. He's also toured with national acts such as the Fray, Zac Brown Band, Marc Broussard and Matt Wertz. In 2009, Nathan caught the attention of a major publishing company, Warner/Chappell. Compelled by his ability to mix modern-pop with classic songwriting, Warner/Chappell signed Nathan to a publishing deal, a rare occasion for an independent artist, and has since been called upon to write for the likes of Kelly Clarkson &amp; Justin Bieber.</p><p>A commercial spin on soul-infused pop, Nathan's latest project Follow Your Heart (2011) emerges as his strongest work to date. Laced with both whimsy and candor, songs like ""Love Is On the Line,"" ""Make Up Your Mind,"" ""Forgetting You"" and ""Hurt Me"" treat the intricacies and frustrations of youth and relationships with due weight yet have a playfulness that lightens the situation. In reference to Follow Your Heart, Nathan calls it ""a very personal project yet one that I believe to be universal in its ability to relate to what we all go through.""</p><p>As much an album title as it is an anthem, Follow Your Heart displays Nathan's ear for melody and keen understanding of story and reveals that he has much in store for fans both new and old.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,2426,The Five One,,http://www.facebook.com/thefiveone ,http://www.youtube.com/thefiveone,http://thefiveone.com/,9702,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">The Late Show!</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Five One's influences range from legendary rock/pop artists to the most iconic figures in hip-hop culture. If you had to define their sound you would have to imagine The Beatles rapping over a punk song made by Bob Marley. Although their sound is refreshing, the most meaningful aspect behind The Five One is their concept. Revalulion [rev-uh-loo-lee-n], is the action of personifying oneself as a color, which is a philosophical term coined by the band. The members of The Five One Red, Blue, Green, and Gold, have simplified themselves from the complexities of societal identity by becoming colors. Defined only by the color in their closets, the color-coded quartet has a niche for meaningful lyrics and a sound that defies the norms of popular music. Trekking around their area now known as the DMV (Washington DC, Maryland, and Virginia), they have spread their music and mythology while sharing the stage with local acts whose genres range from Rock and Reggae to Hip-Hop and R&amp;B. In the summer of 2008 the band played the Afro Punk Festival in Brooklyn, New York joining an eclectic blend of artists such as Janelle Monae, Saul Williams, and Murs. The Five One has always been able to naturally integrate into any music scene or genre. Entering MTV's Dewcircuit Breakout Contest, they obtained national exposure with their song ""Active"" on MTV2, side-by-side various rock acts across the nation.</p><p>With the emergence of niche music blogs, the band gained a lot of attention on the internet through rearranging songs of various artists such as Bob Marley, Lykke Li, N*E*R*D, Gorillaz, Zero 7, Vampire Weekend, Kanye West, and many more. With songs like ""District of Colossus"" and ""What Sarah Said"" The Five One grants listeners a sample of their approach by creating songs that deliver intellectually, as well as providing infectious choruses and melodies. This remix project has accrued over 40,000 downloads, and individual songs and videos have been covered on various sites such as MTVU, USAToday, Chicago Now (Gowherehiphop) and Washington Post. Meeting in Reston, Virginia The Five One has recorded all of their music themselves, in a basement filled with guitars; a drum set, a few microphones, and looped-based recording software. As studio artists their explorations in music are focused on pushing boundaries Implementing samples and loops with live instrumentation. Percussion on their songs sometimes will be a drum kit and other times a chair or bang of a skateboard. Their live show is treated as an opportunity to re-engineer the material into a surprising new form with Red playing guitar, Blue on the drums, Green on keys, and Gold on bass. The Five One's songs deliver a real message in color that will inspire those who take the long and winding road to freedom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,http://twitter.com/thefiveone,,2424,Those Darlins,http://www.myspace.com/darlins ,http://www.facebook.com/thosedarlins,http://youtu.be/QiyXjv1aaf8,http://thosedarlins.com ,9490,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Late Show!<br /><br />This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Four years have gone by since Nikki, Jessi, and Kelley Darlin spat in their palms and slapped hands in a three-way promise that would become Those Darlins. Since then, they've broken hearts and broken bones, all the while honing their chops and gaining a lifetime of experiences through endless touring: bros to the bitter end. Screws Get Loose is their second album--and the first to show off drummer Linwood Regensburg stepping up as a songwriter. Each song bears the scars of the highs and lows they've soldiered through together on the road, accentuating the realities of growing up in a rock and roll band.</p><p>This latest collection of songs reveals the Darlins' road-weary and hardened spirits as the full-throttle charge of their freewheeling early anthems, such as ""Red Light Love"" and ""Wild One,"" has faded into the clarity and the life lessons of , ""Let You Down,"" ""Be Your Bro,"" and the album's title track. In ""Be Your Bro,"" Jessi sings ""I just wanna be your brother, you just wanna be my boyfriend. I just wanna run and play in the dirt with you, you just wanna stick it in."" It's the kind of lyric that any woman can relate to, and the kind of writing that tells a story with just enough detail to make your mind fill in the blanks and make it your own. But the album's true tone culminates in the distant yearning of ""Waste Away"": ""What happened that makes you wanna go face first into the ground? What happened to me that I keep followin' you around?""</p><p>The band re-enlisted producer Jeff Curtin (Small Black) and headed down to Atlanta, GA to record Screws Get Loose with engineer Ed Rawls at his Living Room Studio (Black Lips, Jacuzzi Boys). While the band's country punk nature is still evident, the Southern roots that shine through are more in line with the dirty South garage rock blasting out of Memphis, Atlanta, and Nashville in recent years. Haunting and hook-laden numbers such as ""Hives,"" ""Tina Said,"" and ""BUMD"" tussle with the confessional weight of other songs, like ""Waste Away"" and ""Let U Down."" Stylistically, the band has created a range of sounds: ""Boy"" is reminiscent of Spector's summery girl pop, ""Mystic Mind"" is a fully-realized stoner jam, and ""$"" is a lesson on the slippery nature of money sung in an infestation of gang vocals.</p><p>These songs show that life on the road is no place for the faint of heart. So, naturally, songs take shape with bold narratives, strong voices, and full-bodied performances that are no less vibrant than previous offerings, but are a little less na&iuml;ve. Maturity and experience combine to open up wholly new dimensions for Those Darlins. But that doesn't mean they have forsaken the spirit of fun and frivolity that has come to define them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/those-darlins/id294442860?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/those_darlins,,2421,Eisley,http://myspace.com/eisley,http://www.facebook.com/eisley/,http://www.youtube.com/user/eisley,http://www.eisley.com/,8977,"<p>Eisley is composed of five DuPree family members whose home base is Tyler, Texas, a city known for its rose industry, situated between Dallas and Shreveport, La.

Factory , corrals some of the acclaimed singer-songwriter's most compelling tales to date. A thread runs through its songs, a zigzagging but determinedly solid line that connects the perilous bordertown of Juarez, Mexico to the real and faux glitz of L.A. and the bleak iron range of Minnesota-the Mesabi of the album's title. The broad landscapes created by Tom Russell for Mesabi are inhabited by characters we all know-Bob Dylan, James Dean and Elizabeth Taylor-and some we may not: the now-obscure, once well-known singer Cliff ""Ukulele Ike"" Edwards, the tragic Disney child star Bobby Driscoll and the character actor Sterling Hayden. It's a logical progression from Russell's last album, 2009's Blood and Candle Smoke, yet it's like no other album Russell has made in his nearly four decades as a recording artist.</p><p>His songs have also been recorded by a number of other prominent musicians including Johnny Cash, Guy Clark, Dave Alvin, K.D. Lang, and Suzy Bogguss. Bogguss' rendition of ""Outbound Plane"" became a Top 10 hit on the country charts. Tom Russell has appeared on the David Letterman TV show five times in  the last few years, and his songs have appeared in a dozen movies and  television series including: The new Monte Hellman movie The Road To  Nowhere, Tremors, Songcatcher and Northern Exposure. Tom Russell makes the music he wants to make, without intervention, and he does so without a care for trends and expectations.</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/tom-russell/id4585128?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://www.twitter.com/thomasrussell,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/EIDCYjvj5XU"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",2413,Collective Change Benefit Concert featuring: Pretend and Release + Talk Like They're Famous,,,,,0,"<p>Collective Change is hosting another benefit concert, this time to send 22,000 children's books to schools across Senegal in West Africa.

His forthcoming album ""The David Mayfield Parade"" is an extension of his irrepressible energy and abundant love for the music that has inspired him over his young lifetime.

Raised in Atlanta. Live in Los Angeles.<br />I heard music, melodies and stories in my head as a child.<br />It never went away and I hope it never does.</p><p>After experimenting with drums, piano and other instruments in my teens I began my love/hate affair with the guitar.<br />So, there it is: I am a soul singer that plays guitar.<br />And sometimes: I am a guitarist who sings soulfully.</p><p>Drawn to the blues after hearing songs by Son House, Robert Johnson and others and growing up at a time when Prince, Parliament/Funkadelic, Stevie Wonder and other musicians were stretching the boundaries of popular music I began to understand that music could not and should not be limited by our often narrow views of what it should be.</p><p>Co-founded a band called Follow For Now in 1991 in the hopes of creating a sound that combined all the influences that had been shaping my musical vision:<br />Bad Brains meets Stevie Wonder and Public Enemy in Memphis. While the band had a short life, it was my launching pad, as it allowed me to taste the fruits of such a strange mess of musical ingredients.</p><p>Signed to Brendan O'brien's Columbia imprint in 1997, released a self-titled record and began to spread my wings as an artist, writer and producer.</p><p>Signed to Elektra in 2000, with a band called Brand New Immortals and released Tragic Show. Label folded. Band followed suit.</p><p>Since then I have had the pleasure of writing with, playing with and/or producing artists from Dave Matthews, Cassandra Wilson, Derek Trucks, Santana, Marc Broussard, Guy Sebastian and John Mayer.</p><p>This is still the beginning.</p><p><!--[endif] --></p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fdavid-ryan-harris%252Fid20129043%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/drh3,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/JDvZe-44foA"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",2398,"The Digitour with Dave Days, David Choi, DeStorm, Ricky Ficarelli, The Gregory Brothers",,http://www.facebook.com/#!/TheDigiTour?sk=info,http://www.youtube.com/user/TheDigiTour,http://thedigitour.com/index2.php,0,"<p>The DigiTour is the first ever nation-wide YouTube Tour!</p><p>All your favorite YouTube musicians LIVE ON STAGE!

He grew up in a suburb outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father got him his first guitar when he was only five years old. He still uses it today. Dave played in a band with his friends in middle and high school. They recorded several CD's which almost, but no where near, hit platinum status. Dave would record his band's music and would even record local bands around the area. What an entrepreneur! Dave spelled the word ""wiring"" wrong in his fifth grade spelling bee. Dave might also be writing this ""About Me"" section himself.</p><p>Dave began posting videos during the summer of 2007. His first videos were him parodying and making fun of other YouTubers (mainly LisaNova because she blocked ME FROM SPAMMING HER CHANNEL TOO MUCH!) Anyway.. he started expanding his creativity and began posting videos ranging from silly originals songs to parodies, covers and even skits. His ""OMG THIS GIRL IS SO HOTT!!"" video racked in over one million views in the first day! Wozorz! That video is his most viewed video to date with over 35 million. Dave is most popular for his song parodies. He's parodied artists such as Beyonce, Owl City, Justin Bieber, (list goes on), and Miley Cyrus. Mmmm.. Miley... wait.... where was I... oh yeah... speaking of Miley Cyrus, after several (failed) attempts of trying to win her heart through video, she made a lovable appearance in his ""Last Song for Miley"" video. How cute. Now how about a kiss?</p><p>Dave currently has over 1,200,000 subscribers and 200 million views on YouTube. He's sold over a quarter million songs on iTunes.

Born in Nashville, TN, she came to New York to attend Columbia College, and found that her abiding interest in country music helped her stay connected with her family roots. That interest was the motivation behind her long-running radio program on WFMU in Jersey City, NJ, ""The Radio Thrift Shop."" Beginning on WFMU in 1993, the program was a Saturday afternoon staple in the New York area for 13 years, then moved to WFMU.org and ran for two seasons on BBC Radio Scotland as a summer replacement in 2005 and 2006. In her ten-year recording career, Cantrell has released three acclaimed albums: ""Not The Tremblin' Kind,"" ""When The Roses Bloom Again,"" and ""Humming By The Flowered Vine."" She has toured extensively in the United Kingdom, Europe and Ireland, and was a favorite of pioneering British disc jockey John Peel, who called her 2000 album ""Not The Tremblin' Kind"" ""my favorite record of the last ten years, possibly my life."" Cantrell recorded several Peel sessions for the BBC from 2000-2004 and appeared on the first Peel Day program on Radio One commemorating the first anniversary of Peel's death.</p><p>Cantrell's music has been celebrated in the press including features in The New York Times, ""O"" Magazine, Elle, and the Wall Street Journal. Cantrell's music has been featured on NPR's ""All Things Considered,"" ""On Point,"" and ""Weekend Edition."" She has performed on ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" ""Mountain Stage,"" and the ""Grand Ole Opry,"" and appeared on the television programs ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien,"" and the Sundance Channel's ""Spectacle: Elvis Costello."" In recent years, she has been a contributor to The New York Times and www.VanityFair.com.</p><p>Cantrell has just completed a recording in honor of one of her heroines, Kitty Wells, the ""Queen of Country Music."" A meditation on femininity in country music, the set is entitled ""Kitty Wells Dresses,"" after an original song in tribute to Wells, and will be released in early 2011.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/laura-cantrell/id20335725?uo=4&partnerId=30,,,,2394,The Badrats,,,,http://www.thebadrats.com/,0,"<p>The Badrats_��__ have performed dozens of gigs at clubs, stadiums, parties, schools, festivals and charity events.

Deep Field is also a relaxation technique to enable profound physiological and psychological change, a novel about a young woman's emotional awakening against the backdrop of global conflict and a band from Charleston, Georgia. But while change, growth and music all figure on Joan &lsquo;As Police Woman' Wasser's astounding new album, it's the Hubble image that gave birth to its title. ""I found a photo of a slice of space that is just a tiny spot to the bare eye. But because space is infinite as we understand it so far, the spot spans a massive area, the distance so far, the length so wide, the depth so vast. We know so little about our surroundings. And as is the macrocosm, so is the microcosm, how deep can you delve into your own life... it's endless too.""</p><p>Digging in deeper than ever before, The Deep Field begins with the words ""I want you to fall in love with me,"" and continues to unfurl an unashamed lust for life. It's unquestionably her best, most significant album yet - in Joan's own words, ""my most open, joyous record,"" but it's her most soulful record, and also her most rocking; her most personal, yet her most universal too. ""I went through the process of writing by wanting to speak from a more universal point of view, like, say, Stevie Wonder does, about the human experience. I have to hand it to Stevie, by the way, who single-handedly made being positive cool. There are enough lows in life in general and I am not interested in hanging out in them when I could be dancing.  So I've tried to write songs about hope and being open and free. I knew it would be more challenging because of the clich&eacute; of positivity. I endlessly rewrote the lyrics till they rang true for me. It is not easy being green! Fact is, it's not easy being human sometimes. I'm not living some delusional existence, I have just learned that my thinking dictates my reality.  I am aiming for total freedom. What else is worth living for- especially when it's so obviously there for the taking?  I get bigger bites and more of a taste for it the more I take chances and step out of what I imagine to be my comfort zone. I get closer the more I laugh, the more I use kindness rather than reverting to fear and frustration, the more I learn to soak in the bath of ecstasy. Sound crazy?  Good. ""</p><p>Even on her 2006 debut Real Life, Joan was mainlining positivity. But it wasn't always the case. Born in Maine, adopted at infancy and raised with her adopted brother in Connecticut before joining New York's art/music fraternity, she started distorting the pure tones of her classically trained violin through massive speakers, amid the roaring sound of her formative band years in The Dambuilders, Black Beetle and Those Bastard Souls. ""Anger only arises from other feelings that you're not dealing with,"" Joan said in 2006. ""I'm trying to get deeper.""</p><p>She'd already got broader by playing in Antony's Johnsons and Rufus Wainwright's band, and being band leader for musical director Hal Willner's projects, from his Sea Shanties album to the Neil Young tribute (which was performed again at February's Vancouver Olympics concert). But Joan's own music has taken centre stage, with its glowing, sultry pulse, but always with a palpable tension and turbulence beneath the apparent serenity.  As her new track &lsquo;The Magic' puts it, ""I am fine, I am divine / But there's a wild ride going on behind the sign."" Real Life was a soulful, torchy universe that aligned her with the likes of Annette Peacock, PJ Harvey, Dusty (In Memphis era) Springfield, and Laura Nyro, but also the soulful glow of Al Green. The rapturously acclaimed debut made The Word Magazine's Best Albums of the Naughties among other accolades), followed up by 2008's To Survive, which began the process of digging deep to the place where The Deep Field starts, a major leap forward, and then some. The opening &lsquo;Nervous' is instant proof, with its tribal/urban beat leading into a taut drum intro, Moog bass, surging female back-ups and flaming guitar coda. Joan says she was smitten by Marvin Gaye, Sly and the Family Stone, Bowie, Curtis Mayfield and Stevie Wonder too, on The Deep Field, the bliss and funk levels rise. Of the ten songs, three break the six-minute mark - ""I wanted the music to feel freer, to be my Maggot Brain!"" Joan says, referring to the Funkadelic classic - and all work up a head of steam. Simply, this record cooks. Sometimes it simmers, and by the time she reaches the soaring finale &lsquo;I Was Everyone', it reaches boiling point.</p><p>The energy behind this transition is partly down to the album's rat-pack of musicians, both old and new to Joan's records and stage outfits. ""I am lucky, living in New York City and playing in so many different situations; I get to choose from the creamiest of the crop. All total bad-ass free-thinkers!"" she beams. Producer Bryce Goggin returns for the third time, alongside drummer (and back-up singer) Parker Kindred, Moog bassist and organist Tyler Wood, guitarist Timo Ellis, clavinet virtuoso Chris Brown, bassist Nathan Larson (of Shudder To Think fame, who's also responsible for the gorgeous R&amp;B-smooth vox on &lsquo;Chemmie') and Doug Wieselman on horns and that climatic guitar solo on &lsquo;Nervous'.  There are five bassists involved - ""I wanted different feels for different songs"" -  three female back-up singers and, among the male voices, Joseph Arthur, whose trademark mahogany baritone was heard on Real Life and Joan's recent Covers stop-gap album and now guests on &lsquo;Run For Love', &lsquo;Flash', &lsquo;Human Condition' and &lsquo;Forever And A Year'.</p><p>But the overriding change has been Joan's own life - coming to terms with her mother's passing, surviving a couple of un-nourishing relationships and also turning 40 in July this year. ""A lot of people seem to shy away from birthdays, especially their fortieth, but I tend to embrace change; I've attempted to do the opposite in the past and boy, does that hurt, and not work,"" she declares. ""Turning 40 was an opportunity to embrace another level of letting go; of expectations from others, of worn-out voices in my head and generally of any semblance of what I may have once thought I should be. I've done a lot to raise my self-esteem.  A lot has to do with helping other people. Remember, I am aiming for total freedom here, people.""</p><p>One opportunity came by joining Damon Albarn's Africa Express mission to Ethiopia earlier this year. ""I had an unexpectedly cathartic experience. Everywhere we went, on the street or in the clubs, people would start talking to you, asking where you are from and within no time, they had sat you down at their table, introduced you to the guy they were going to marry, their sisters and their husbands, their friends, their parents...Honestly, it made me feel better about talking to anyone and everyone on the NYC subway.  It was lovely to be reminded of how we could all communicate with each other, all the time, if we took the chance. There is so much ease there. There is no time or space for worrying about being cool. These people began civilization. They don't have to be concerned with anything.  They are the creators of cool.""</p><p>In the calm, sultry &lsquo;Human Condition', Joan sings ""I smile at strangers knowing it's alright / When they smile right back at me / I know we agree / That good living requires smiling at strangers."" She calls the track ""the crux of the album,"" but every track contains personal revelation and emotional collision. &lsquo;Nervous' concerns what Joan calls ""the freedom to admit you're vulnerable and anxious,"" in a new-found relationship, rather than just projecting bravado. A stewing &lsquo;Run For Love' also involves courtship where both parties are ""angling to get with the other, each trying to communicate their interest in the other and that excitement, agitation and anticipation of the new connection.""</p><p>&lsquo;Chemmie' is an exclusively positive spin on that dance, experiencing the ""undeniable chemistry that soars past logic"" that exists between lovers, wrapped up in the form of &lsquo;60s Philly soul. Another of the gentler grooves, &lsquo;Action Man' even dares to suggest to stop thinking and intellectualizing and just surrender to the here and now (""Ain't we talked enough already / And don't you wanna be the action man? / Let's dance"") inspired by what Joan calls, ""the ease,"" of Marvin Gaye's arrangements on his Here My Dear album.</p><p>Other songs are on a more singular trip. A forceful &lsquo;The Magic' involves trying to find, ""the alchemy,"" to stop the brain spinning into self-destructive obsession. &lsquo;Flash' - written during a solo trip to Mexico - is a song of self-acceptance, the &lsquo;flash"" being the realisation you have moved on without really knowing how. The hazy &lsquo;60s psych folk feel only compliments the hazy mood. &lsquo;Kiss The Specifics' (which harks back to Real Life's luminous glide), is ""for the lack of a better way to express it, about being in love with being alive. Being grateful."" ""I will never be careful what I wish for,"" she croons, and means it.</p><p>Even more than &lsquo;Flash', &lsquo;Forever And A Year' is the album's most haunting reverie, epitomized by its plea ""Give in to the night / the legs of afterglow / the last leap open"" and finally  ""I may go/ As soon as now / So I'm telling you /  I love you forever / And this is always sealed / Within the deep deep field.""</p><p>Which leaves one very crucial song.  &lsquo;I Was Everyone' closes the album on an ecstatic high, which makes sense given the inspiration was Joan of Arc, who Joan was named after. It's sung from Joan Of Arc's perspective, of the self-doubt and self-worth she experienced when receiving visions. As the music reaches boiling point, the lyrics nail the same core as &lsquo;Human Condition; ""What if I woke up tomorrow not afraid? / I could decide to trust the voices and take courage...For a moment I could feel it / I could feel it / For a moment I was everyone who had never been quiet / How would I spend my whole life?"" <br />""This idea is very important to me,"" Joan concludes. ""What if Rosa Parks hadn't spoken up? What if people didn't say what they thought?  I have to trust myself. It's a song about honouring oneself.""</p><p>Some artists play a part, act stuff out, and like to hide behind imagery. That's fine, but it's not for everyone. Some, like Joan, want to communicate direct, to tell the truth, and share the honesty. To honour themselves and their audience. It may be clich&eacute; to read about it but wonderful to experience. Because this is real life. This is the deep field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,2383,MetalFest: A Japan Earthquake Benefit Concert Featuring Iris Divine,http://www.myspace.com/irisdivine,,,,8876,"<p>Iris Divine. The name is hard to capture, at once spiritual, beautiful and powerful - and, a reflection of the lyrics and music of one of the best-kept secrets in unsigned heavy rock.</p><p>Iris Divine is a modern rock band with progressive elements, and diverse influences ranging from pop to metal. The band has a sound that can be radio-friendly and accessible, with big vocal hooks, vocal harmonies and heavy riffs, but also challenges the listener with a unique technical edge.</p><p>The story begins in 2008 when Navid and Farhad, both lead singer/guitarist/songwriters in their respective projects, found each other available as both bands had coincidentally dissolved within days of each other.</p><p>They soon decided to collaborate and discovered a unique songwriting chemistry, fusing Farhad's multi-instrumental ability and gift for melody with Navid's penchant for powerful metal riffing and prolific composition. Needing a rhythm section, they drafted two of Farhad's former bandmates. Tanvir and Brian, already a powerful and tightly syncopated unit, came on board to complete the Iris Divine lineup.</p><p>Iris Divine's live show delivers the precision of their recorded work, with complex rhythm changes, raw energy and the on-stage movement of an arena-ready heavy rock act. The band has played countless shows in the DC/ Virginia area, has traveled to other states like Delaware, Maryland, New York, and has opened for national acts such as Sonata Arctica and 3 Inches of Blood.</p><p>Ultimately following in the tradition of bands like Tool, Muse and Faith No More, Iris Divine seeks to attract a mainstream audience with uncompromising originality, rather than trying to adapt to whatever happens to be popular this week. Look for more shows, and a new studio recording, from Iris Divine in 2010. In the meantime, check out their debut EP and single Broken (Arms of Heaven), available on iTunes.</p>",,,,,2374,Tribute to Bob Dylan On his 70th Birthday Jammin_��_��_ Java_��_��_s Songwriters Circle Featuring,http://www.myspace.com/jamminjavasongwritercircle,,,,9424,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Celebrate folk legend Bob Dylan's 70th birthday with 4 of D.C.'s own singer/songwriters.

This is an album for sleepwalkers, skeletons and gravediggers, for those who have fallen so far down they can taste the soil between their teeth. A more immediate and visceral collection than the previous multi platinum selling Songs From The Deep Forest, the new album's many moments of beauty and hope are juxtaposed with a dark, brooding edge- the trademark twist of the Duke.</p><p>Recorded between Wapping, London; Champaign, Illinois and Culleybackey, Northern Ireland, I Never Thought This Day Would Come was produced by long-time collaborator Paul Pilot and mixed by Nick Terry, best known for his work with the Klaxons and The Libertines. In a deliberate attempt to push outwards, Duke Special undertook many writing collaborations for this album including sessions with Daniel Benjamin - drummer with German punk band Jumbo Jet, Paul Pilot, Phil Wilkinson and Bernard Butler.  The wind, brass and percussion of the RTE Symphony Orchestra, under the stewardship of the inimitable David Brophy, add a swirling carnival flavour to the proceedings.</p><p>Since the release of Songs From The Deep Forest, Duke Special has toured sold out shows across Ireland, the UK and Europe. From headlining a packed-to-the-rafters Shepherds Bush Empire in London to stage diving at Electric Picnic, hosting five sell out nights back-to-back at Belfast's Empire Music Hall to appearing as a special guest performer at the Cannes Film Festival, Duke Special has come further than he ever imagined he might. Crowded House invited him along on their first tour in ten years, he gave a little known Welsh singer called Duffy her first ever shows, guested for the legendary Ray Davies in London and performed at The Irish Film Boards Oscar Wilde event in LA.</p><p>Duke Special's immense creative talents have seen him writing the theme tune for Sesame Tree - the Northern Ireland edition of Sesame Street - where he also got to sing with The Muppets in the final episode. He has hosted a night at the Belfast Film Festival where he performed as a puppet of himself. He recently created a night of song and theatre in the Spiegeltent for the Dublin Fringe Festival and performed his songs accompanied by a 60 piece strong RTE Symphony Orchestra at a sold out show in Dublin's National Concert Hall. The Duke is currently learning to swordfight for an upcoming on stage showdown with his longtime nemesis, Neil Hannon. Duke Special is the fucked up ringmaster of a broken down circus, the lead dancer in a forgotten ballroom of ghosts, the loudest singer in a midnight choir and the first on his knees in an old time revival tent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,2356,The Good Time Tour: Ben Rector,http://www.myspace.com/benrector,http://www.facebook.com/benrector,http://www.youtube.com/benrector,http://www.benrectormusic.com/,11396,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.<br /></span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Jammin Java turns 10 this October!

She plays-not just one instrument, but enough of them to be a one-woman string band: mandolin, octave mandolin, clawhammer banjo and guitar.  She sings-in supple tones that transcend the boundaries between folk and pop - and she writes-old-timey ballads and modern singer-songwriter ruminations alike.  Raised 30 miles out of Austin in Wimberley, Tex., Jarosz blossomed within the local music scene and well beyond it, earning admirers from Austin City Limit's Terry Lickona to acoustic music mavens Tim O'Brien and Chris Thile with her mature sensibilities. She released her debut, Song Up In Her Head, on Sugar Hill Records the year she graduated high school.   What followed was a move to Boston's prestigious New England Conservatory, a GRAMMY nomination and performances on ""Austin City Limits"" and ""A Prairie Home Companion""  as well as prestigious music festivals--Bonnaroo, Telluride and Newport, to name a few.  In 2011, Jarosz channels her ever-broadening musical horizons onto her second album, Follow Me Down, which again showcases her songwriting, offers two tasty covers and includes a number of top-notch guests from the Punch Brothers to Shawn Colvin.</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/sarah-jarosz/id265130262?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://www.twitter.com/sarahjarosz,,2353,Mike Viola,http://www.myspace.com/mikeviola ,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Mike-Viola/115339369850?v=app_178091127385#!/pages/Mike-Viola/115339369850?v=app_178091127385,http://www.mikeviola.com/video/,http://www.mikeviola.com/,8547,"<p>Mike Viola is best known as singer, songwriter and musical architect of the Candy Butchers, a highly regarded pop-rock band from New York that recorded three critically-acclaimed albums for Sony, including 2003's fan-favorite Hang On Mike. The success of the Candy Butchers led to multiple appearances on Late Night With Conan O'Brien and Last Call With Carson Daly. It also found the group touring alongside the likes of They Might Be Giants, Robyn Hitchcock, Semisonic, Sparklehorse, Barenaked Ladies, and Ivy.<br /> <br />Viola simultaneously began a career in film-work a decade ago as the co-producer and lead singer of the Oscar-nominated title track from ""That Thing You Do!"".<br /> <br />Walk Hard, the recent Jake Kasdan/Judd Apatow film starring John C. Reilly, featured nearly a dozen songs written by Viola. A spoof on the Hollywood music biopic, Walk Hard proved to be the perfect playground for Viola's subversive, witty lyrics and catchy-pop expertise.<br /> <br />Viola joined the indie ranks in 2005 when he released an album of new songs on his own label, Good Morning Monkey Records. Recorded live at Largo in L.A., Just Before Dark showcases Mike's sharp abilities as a live performer. Once available on his website, mikeviola.com, the vinyl-only album sold out in three months.<br /> <br />His latest album, Lurch, is alive with the classic-pop euphoria and vivid storybook imagery that Viola's fans have come to treasure. Lurch has captured audiences internationally, thanks to tracks like album-opener ""Maybe, Maybe Not"" and first single ""So Much Better"", which charted in Denmark.<br /> <br />As signed worldwide to EMI Music Publishing, Viola remains a prolific songwriter and/or producer on a multitude of projects. His work can be heard on Amanda Leigh, the recent release by Mandy Moore -- for whom he is also Musical Director-in addition to collaborations with Inara George, Tim Christensen, Dan Bern, Steve McEwan, Kelly Jones, Ryan Adams, Drake Bell, Bleu, Adam Schlesinger, John C.

The new record entitled ""The World We Know"" is the follow-up to 2004's self-titled record. This release marks the end of an era for Enders, and the start of a new decade fresh off west coast independent Drive-thru records.</p><p>The record is the first of a series of three bundles of music that will come out this year, each of them appropriately considered ""albums."" The first release will be available everywhere digitally including Itunes with a presale on Amazon and signed copies available on tour. The second record will be released immediately preceding the Van's Warped tour and the third will be released in late fall. Another touch that makes this record completely different, it's one 40 minute song. That's right - although the record consists of a standard amount of songs, the record never really stops, the songs continue into each other. It's a vision that Ace has had for awhile and is finally able to do with a record outside of the standard riggers of the record label system. Ace comments, ""I certainly have no problem with people buying songs instead of albums, but with this project, much like the last Mess record, I want it to be about the experience.""</p><p>On the new record, Enders has something a bit different than his recent records - back to the basics. Fans of songs like The Early November's ""Ever So Sweet,"" ""Sunday Drive,"" and any of the I Can Make A Mess songs from 2004, will likely embrace this record. ""This is a record meant to listen to when you're alone with your headphones on,"" comments Ace when speaking about the new music. Enders would admit that the first record was about growing up, and not a lot has changed, ""The World We Know"" is a social commentary on continuing to grow up, how things change, and the changes in life with the birth of his new child in late 2009.</p>",,,,,2322,Ian Axel,http://www.myspace.com/ianaxel,http://www.facebook.com/IanAxelMusic ,http://www.youtube.com/ianaxelmusic,http://www.ianaxel.com/,11011,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Early show!</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""> </span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Emerging singer-songwriters Ian Axel, Allie Moss, and Bess Rogers have landed in your town, with a 20-city late summer tour that spans the East and West coasts.

Ian officially ""touched down"" in 2011 when he released his debut full-length, This Is the New Year.  The title track received over 1 million YouTube views, he performed on the nationally syndicated Rachael Ray Show and on La Blogoth&eacute;que's world-renown Take Away Shows, and his songs were featured on TV shows such as ""One Tree Hill,"" and as the theme to the MTV documentary series I Used to Be Fat.</p><p>However, it's Ian's live show that shoots him to new frontiers.  He has an energy that recalls the intimacy, energy and excitement of performers like Regina Spektor, Elton John and Randy Newman.  NPR described him as ""a voice that possesses the sweetness of youth, the stubbornness of a teenager and the swagger of a rock star.""  He is capable of captivating an audience as only the greatest performers do, an appeal that has not gone unnoticed, leading to opening gigs for Ingrid Michaelson, Evan Dando and, most recently, for Glee star Matthew Morrison's at the 2500-capacity Beacon Theater on August 1st.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/ian-axel/id251002233?uo=4&partnerId=30 ,,http://twitter.com/ianaxel ,,2320,Ethan Douglas Band,http://www.myspace.com/ethandouglasband ,,,,0,"<p>There aren't enough Folk and Americana musicians in the world today and, at the very least, not any kind like Ethan Douglas.

He released OneManStand the following year. The album features a backing band for Ethan Douglas, which includes Ethan performing all the drum, bass, guitar, harmonica, and vocal parts. Ethan's music is heavily influenced by the style of his birthplace of Texas. Though he grew up in Virginia, Texan music was with him all his life. There are definite influences from legendary artists such as Bob Dylan, John Prine, Townes VanZant, Joe Ely and Lyle Lovett. Much like his influences, his songs are slice-of-life moments we sometimes take for granted. He was also a member of the short-lived yet highly influential band HOME from 2002 - 2005. His song, ""Moss on a Tree,"" was selected for an acoustic music sampler to be featured alongside music from other contemporary artists such as Pete Seeger and David Grisman.</p>",,,,,2317,Slow

to put in there because otherwise the bio is thin and it's completely obvious how unsuccessful you really are.<br />ex. Slow Runner started in 2003 when singer/songwriter Michael Flynn and multi-instrumentalist Josh Kaler began musically fornicating together after college.<br />Step 2 - Create a mythos around how your &lsquo;sound' was formed.<br />ex. One night while walking through the woods Michael and Josh pulled a sword from a stone and the curtains of heaven opened up and they simultaneously realized their musical destiny involved casio, loud drums, and short pop songs about girls.<br />Step 3 - Puff your chest out and list accomplishments no matter how insignificant they might be.<br />ex. Michael Flynn almost won the John Lennon Songwriting Scholarship in 2001. Then he did win the Flat Rock Music Festival Songwriting Contest, then he and Kaler made &lsquo;No Disassemble', formed a full band, and signed a deal with J Records in 2005.<br />Step 4 - Totally ignore inexplicable gaps in the narrative of the bio.<br />ex. What happened to our deal with J Records? Shut up. What happened to your mom, that's the real question. Move along, there's nothing to see here!<br />Step 5 - Start name-dropping like you're trying to get into the v.i.p. room at Tonic on a Friday night. This step is extremely important.<br />ex. Slow Runner has toured with folks like Josh Ritter, The Damnwells, Say Anything, Built to Spill, Gomez, The Avett Brothers, and Evan Dando, as well as had their music featured on shows like Greys Anatomy and One Tree Hill.<br />Step 5b (optional) - If you've gotten any press, sprinkle some of that in for additional legitimacy.<br />ex.  Paste Magazine names Slow Runner one of 25 bands worth watching due to the ""sonic atmosphere - elegant, corroded, and lurking about ... Slow Runner is the rare band that can mourn and bewail, then hope and ramble on, all with one hand on the blip-and-bloop button for good measure.""<br />ex. ""..set to do for geek-rock what Zach Braff did for television sitcoms- re-define ultra cool.""  -blogcritics.org<br />ex.  ...""at first listen makes you summon that Shazam app on your iPhone and ask, &lsquo;Who's that?'""  -Huffington Post<br />Step 6 - Mention the new guys.<br />ex. Michael and Josh are now lucky enough to be playing with Jonathan Gray (formerly of Jump Little Children) on bass and Scott Baumil (formerly of The Young Republicans) on guitar. [notice the extra name-dropping I snuck in there with parenthesis? Bonus points!]<br />Step 7 - Mention the new product you're trying to shove down people's ears. Make it sound badass.</p>",,,,,2316,Ezra Furman & The Harpoons,http://www.myspace.com/ezrafurman,http://www.facebook.com/ezrafurmanandtheharpoons,,http://www.ezrafurman.com/,8477,"<p>Americans have an undeniable and insatiable appetite for voyeurism.  Readily feeding them hearty portions is front-man Ezra Furman, who makes no qualms about peddling the deeply personal to the public and draws no drapes between himself and an audience thanks to his pulsating, confessional songwriting style.  Through his eponymous Chicago-based quartet, Ezra Furman &amp; the Harpoons, Furman employs the same open-chest honesty that drew ire for Ginsberg's Howl and spawned speculation of Cohen's Chelsea Hotel as he pines for his Wild Rosemarie and recounts bouts of transience during the making of the band's upcoming third studio LP, Mysterious Power.</p><p>With lyrics featuring the fittingly dualistic motif of blood - representing both the humor d'amour and the stomach-turning stains of tragedy - Furman's music madly swings between wide-eyed sentimentality and brutally truthful accounts of life's grotesqueries.  Forging ahead with Furman's brazenly rust-tinged croons, the band solders rollicking rockabilly rhythm and love-struck doo-wop sensibility with punk-rock ferocity and immediacy.  In a musical alloy as unlikely as it is engaging, Furman finds release for bleeding-heart sensitivity and bloody-knuckled brawls of conscience as he ""declares open warfare on jadedness, cynicism and irony.""  (Greg Kot, Chicago Tribune)</p><p>Ezra Furman &amp; The Harpoons are putting forth their tautest album to date with Mysterious Power, as produced by Doug Boehm (French Kicks, Starsailor).  There is an impressive range of styles and sounds in this newest set of songs, but there is also a palpable cohesiveness that can in part be attributed to the full incorporation of guitarist Andrew Langer.  A veteran of the Chicago-area outfit The Redwalls, Langer was used only in guest spots on the band's second album; however, his being woven into the fabric of Mysterious Power, along with the eruptive energy of Adam Abrutyn's drumbeats and the volatile McCartney-wails of Job Mukkada's harmonies, lends a complementary sonic counterweight to Furman's lyrics that drives the music forward.</p><p>Don't Turn Your Back on Love and Wild Rosemarie are so intensely delicate and gorgeous they have a haltingly powerful presence.  The anthemic catharsis of Teenage Wasteland and the frantic crescendos of Blood Sucking Whore reveal piercing vulnerabilities beneath their bold arrangements.  The Harpoons deftly toy with dynamics more like the Pixies than a folk-rock group on tracks like Heaven At the Drive-In, while mixing in Is-This-It-inspired guitar hooks on Portraits of Maude and Blue-Album-style backing harmonies on I Killed Myself but Didn't Die.  This third LP puts a stronger emphasis on beauty, building on earlier releases that toyed more with the irrepressible energy of youth.  This progress is perhaps best showcased by Wild Feeling and the album's title track, Mysterious Power.</p><p>Ezra Furman &amp; the Harpoons have made numerous album of the year lists with their debut Banging Down the Doors and sophomore release Inside the Human Body.  They have gained critical acclaim for performances with Lou Reed at South by Southwest, Alec Ounsworth of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, The Walkmen, Spoon, and Delta Spirit, as well as at major festivals such as Lollapalooza.  They have attained international notoriety by soaring to the number-one spot on European radio stations and playing to thousands at Barcelona's Primavera music festival.  Ezra personally embarked on the quixotic feat of recording an original and personalized song for every person who bought a special self-released EP.  On top of all of this, Ezra Furman &amp; the Harpoons deliver live performances that will leave you buzzing with excitement.    <br /> <br />Furman gallops and crashes around the stage like an asylum-bound Buddy Holly complete with endearing hiccups and frightening tics.  He not only christens every tour with a nom de rock, but also titles each individual gig.  Furman's witty and effusive conversations with the audience, along with his heightened attention to the crowd's prevailing mood and the shows named like children, creates an extremely personalized feel for every performance.  The band grinds out riffs stoically and belts out harmonies spiritedly as they lay the aural ties to support the verbal locomotion of Furman as he careens and caroms about, filling the room with the boiling-hot emotional steam of a fully bared soul.</p><p>Ezra Furman -Vocals, Guitar<br />Andrew Langer - Guitar<br />Job Mukkada - Bass<br />Adam Abrutyn - Drums</p>",,,,,2314,Jesse Winchester,,,,http://www.jessewinchester.com/,8384,"<p>If you listen to many of the songs Jesse Winchester has written in his professional career, now nearing four decades, you&rsquo;ll hear most of the elements of what&rsquo;s become known as &ldquo;Americana&rdquo; &ndash; detailed, empathetic stories of everyday people set to music incorporating folk, country, bluegrass, blues and gospel instrumentation.&nbsp; <br /><br />How ironic, then, that a musician with such a strong sense of personal and musical roots should make the life changing decision to leave his Memphis home in 1967 and resettle in Canada in defiance of his draft notice, a.k.a. an invitation to fight in Vietnam.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Born on the air force base &ndash; another irony &ndash; in Bossier City, La., where his father was stationed, Jesse was mostly raised in Memphis, where the Winchester name was well-established in local politics and society. There were ten years of piano lessons ahead, playing guitar in high school bands, and attendance at Williams College in Massachusetts, where Jesse made the first dramatic change in his life. During a year of studies overseas, he joined a rock band in Munich, Germany, and toured there before and after his 1966 graduation. <br /><br />But in the mid-Sixties, graduating from college almost inevitably led to military service, and Jesse soon received his draft notice back in Memphis. Aware of the consequences, he bought a one-way ticket to Montreal and fly north with his guitar and a few hundred dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />After a few years of playing piano in Canadian bars and teaching himself to write songs, Jesse met Robbie Robertson, lead guitarist and main writer for The Band, the legendary quintet of former Dylan backing musicians, &ldquo;through a friend of a friend.&rdquo; Robertson produced Jesse&rsquo;s self-titled debut album, enlisting fellow Band-mate Levon Helm on drums and mandolin and whiz-kid musician Todd Rundgren as engineer. That first album was released with the most low-key packaging possible &ndash; no lyrics and a gatefold cover with the same photo of Jesse on all four panels, resembling a 19th Century &ldquo;Wanted Dead or Alive&rdquo; poster. <br />&nbsp;<br />Fortunately, Jesse&rsquo;s songs spoke for themselves. That first album included reputation-building original compositions like the homesick &ldquo;Yankee Lady&rdquo; (covered by Tim Hardin, Brewer &amp; Shipley, and atthews&rsquo; Southern Comfort&rdquo;), &ldquo;Biloxi&rdquo; (Jimmy Buffett, Tom Rush, Ted Hawkins), &ldquo;Brand New Tennessee Waltz&rdquo; (The Everly Brothers, Patti Page, Ronnie Hawkins) and the rollicking &ldquo;Payday&rdquo; (Elvis Costello, Alex Taylor). <br />&nbsp;<br />Although his inability to tour the US hampered his career until President Carter declared amnesty for draft defiers in 1977, Winchester remained based in Canada, writing and recording great songs that solidified his critical acclaim and popularity among other artists. Jesse&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rhumba Girl&rdquo; was a pop hit for Nicolette Larson, &ldquo;Well-a-Wiggy&rdquo; reached the R&amp;B charts in a version by the Weather Girls, and Michael Martin Murphey had a Top 10 country single with &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Gonna Miss You, Girl,&rdquo; which Jesse finally recorded for his new Love Filling Station CD. Reba McIntyre and Wynonna Judd have been among the most regular outlets for his songs. Jesse even had his own Top 40 hit with &ldquo;Say What&rdquo; in 1981.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />After releasing seven albums between 1970 and 1981, Jesse took some time off to recharge, living on the royalties from his songs. He broke cover again with 1988&rsquo;s Humour Me, which was followed by another long wait for 1999&rsquo;s Gentleman of Leisure. In 2002, Jesse and his new wife finally relocated back to the States, in Virginia. While Winchester has maintained an active touring schedule during much of his career, his return to the recording studio to cut Love Filling Station after a nine-year absence was inspired by that most romantic of reasons: &ldquo;My wife kept bugging me.&rdquo;</p>",,,,,2309,Boys Will Be Boys,http://www.myspace.com/boyswillbeboys,http://www.facebook.com/boyswillbeboysrock,,,8344,,,,,,2308,Afton-0215,,,,,8401,,,,,,2306,Casey,http://www.myspace.com/caseysband,http://www.facebook.com/CaseyOfficial,http://www.youtube.com/caseysband,http://www.caseyofficial.com/,0,"<p>""For a guy who just recently quit his day job to cut a CD and pursue his musical dream, Casey - and his eponymous CD - is stunningly good. Armed with an acoustic guitar, a harmonica and a gift for turning a phrase, Casey manages to breathe new life into the rather stale folk genre. Upbeat and propulsive, ""Rock Star Voodoo"" is a plea to a lover to help him hold on to a fading relationship amidst the swirl of big city dreams. In the typical folk tradition, these are straightforward songs with rather simple arrangements, but Casey's voice - conveying just the right mix of sincerity and grit - and his effective pacing, is likely to get you bobbing your head or tapping your foot - or both. On ""Boy With Guitar,"" Casey makes a plaintive case for following his dream. ""Our teachers lie when they say you can't get by on doing what you love,"" he sings. Here's hoping Casey is right."" -Michael Coleman</p>",,,,,2300,Allen Thompson Band,http://www.myspace.com/allenthompsonmusic,http://www.facebook.com/allenthompsonmusic,http://www.youtube.com/user/allent28 ,http://www.allenthompsonmusic.com/fr_home.cfm,0,"<p>Some folks' paths are determined for them before they are old enough to wonder what their paths should be. Such is the case with Allen Thompson. Thompson has been singing and telling stories for longer than he can remember. Judging by the responses to his albums and live performances, he won't be stopping anytime soon.</p><p>Allen's songwriting and performing abilities have been recognized and applauded by Relix Magazine, American Songwriter, Jambands.com, and even CMT. Allen's continued growth as a songwriter and performer is evident. Audiences from South Carolina to California and many points in between are falling in love with his mournful vocals and honest turns of phrase.</p><p>""I'm excited to see my music getting such a great response from people. When I made my last record (2009's 26 Years), I was afraid to put it out. It's nice to know folks out there understand what I'm doing. It's also very surprising. I didn't expect the record to elicit much of a reaction from anyone. I thought it was too personal, too real,"" he chuckles.</p><p>""Then again, the artists who inspired me made personal music for themselves and their friends with little concern for whether or not it would have mass appeal. I couldn't see myself doing this for any reason other than to say the things I feel I need to say.""</p><p>It is precisely that attitude that draws listeners to Allen's music. Thompson was born to tell a story. The first time you hear his sweet, soulful voice sail through one of his songs like the wind whistling through the mountains, you'll want to listen again and again to the stories he is telling.</p>",,,,,2298,Moona Luna,http://www.myspace.com/moonalunamusic,http://www.facebook.com/moonalunamusic,http://www.moonalunamusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/youtube-icon-PNG1.png,http://www.moonalunamusic.com/,14066,"<p><em>""There have been other attempts, some pretty good, but Moona Luna's Pinata Party may be the bilingual kindie rock album lots of families have been waiting for."" - Zooglobble</em></p><p><em><br /></em>Moona Luna is the passionate second project of New York-based songwriter Sandra Velasquez and her critically acclaimed Latin band Pistolera.

But the experience didn't slow her down.&nbsp; In fact, with her daughter as inspiration, Velasquez wrote an album's worth of songs geared for families. After writing exclusively in Spanish for Pistolera, she decided to make Moona Luna's songs bilingual so that her simple messages of joy, discovery and perseverance would reach more young ears.<br />Pi&ntilde;ata Party is a new CD of bouncy, Latin-inspired bilingual music that perfectly captures the spirit of an outdoor family party.

So begins the title track from John Mark McMillan's new release, Economy. A natural progression and a departure, McMillan's latest album has moved away from the themes of death and resurrection that clothed The Medicine to the interior psychology of a man trying to live in the uneasy valley between this world and the next, standing on the edge of the ocean of eternity, straining to see beyond the horizon line.</p><p>On Economy, that tension is electric. From the first drumbeat of album opener ""Sheet of Night"" to the post-rock cacophony that closes out ""Seen a Darkness,"" there is a palpable weight that permeates the entire project. This is Gospel music run through the filter of the Southern night; this is electrified folk-the music of a man who cut his teeth on Dylan and Kerouac and Springsteen all the while haunted by the presence of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.</p><p>Economy is the sound of glory and shame, murder and race, darkness and daylight and all those spaces in between. And it shows up in the songs-in the delicate beauty of ""Love You Swore,"" in the rowdy drawl of ""Daylight,"" and the quiet solemnity of ""Murdered Son.""</p><p>For those following McMillan's steady rise as an artist, Economy will not disappoint. Having grown as a lyricist and musician-this body of work finds the North Carolina-based artist at his most mature. And sonically, the album is far greater than the sum of its parts, served by the production team of Jeremy Griffith and Joel Khouri, and performed by the musicians that have supported McMillan across the world. The team has created a perfect accompaniment to McMillan's searching, searing vision of a world that is ""not as it should be.""But it's not just a broken world that McMillan's singing about. With Economy, he's pointing out across the horizon, across the waters, to the hope of something <br />much more than the devil's ""broken hearts and counterfeit currency.""  <br /> <br />""We have seen the night,"" John Mark sings, and then adds, ""but we have seen the day.""</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">Jude Moses </span><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/judemosesmusic"">official site</a></h5><p>&nbsp;</p><h5><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">The Royal Royal</span> <a href=""http://www.theroyalroyal.com/"">official site</a></h5><p><img height=""223"" src=""http://jamminjava.com/ee-assets/gallery/artists/adult-artists/theroyalroyal.jpg"" width=""200"" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""></span><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/judemosesmusic""></a></p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fjohn-mark-mcmillan%252Fid416748330%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/johnmarkmc,"<iframe src=""http://player.vimeo.com/video/35649895?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"" width=""640"" height=""480"" frameborder=""0"" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/35649895"">John Mark Economy Class Tour on Sale now www.thejohnmark.com</a> from <a href=""http://vimeo.com/theparadigmcollective"">The Paradigm Collective</a> on <a href=""http://vimeo.com"">Vimeo</a>.</p></br><iframe src=""http://player.vimeo.com/video/35330502?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"" width=""640"" height=""480"" frameborder=""0"" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/35330502"">The RoyalRoyal ""Love Trailer"" Official Video @iTunes Feb 14th</a> from <a href=""http://vimeo.com/theparadigmcollective"">The Paradigm Collective</a> on <a href=""http://vimeo.com"">Vimeo</a>.</p>",2292,Jimmy Robbins + School Boy Humor,,,,,0,,,,,,2286,Oakton DECA -Pink Rhythm,,,,,8239,"<p>The concert is brought to you by Oakton DECA and called ""Pink Rhythm."" <br /> <br />Come out for a pink-inspired night with local musical talent, food, drinks, free stuff, and more!

,http://hotclubofcowtown.com/ ,0,"<p>The story begins with a classic musical travel adventure: an ad in the music section of New York City's Village Voice. In the mid-'90s Elana James was looking to join a ""gigging band"" when Whit Smith answered her ad. Though he had no shows on the books, Whit somehow convinced Elana to come down to his East Village apartment and rock out for an evening just to see what would happen. When she arrived, he opened the door in big furry slippers and the rest is history.</p><p>More than a decade later, the Hot Club of Cowtown has grown to be the most globe-trotting, hard-swinging Western Swing trio on the planet. From early days busking for tips in San Diego's Balboa Park, the band has grown and developed into a formidable international sensation. The Hot Club's ever-growing presence on the international festival scene has grown with its relentless touring over the years alongside the release of five critically acclaimed CDs on American Roots label HighTone Records. In August 2008 the Hot Club's sixth CD, ""The Best of the Hot Club of Cowtown,"" a hand-picked, band-picked, twenty-song retrospective, was released by Shout!Factory.</p><p>After a two-year hiatus during 2005-2007 the band went its separate ways, reuniting in 2008 with a packed tour schedule and a new studio CD of original material slated for release in early 2009.</p><p>In the meantime, some things haven't changed. The band--Elana James on violin and vocals, Whit Smith on guitar and vocals, and Jake Erwin on bass and vocals--still swings harder than ever as it continues to develop it's unique, ever-evolving sound. This journey, which began with the roots of the Hot Jazz era, Americana music, vintage pop and folk music, continues to unfold into the new sound of the group's original songs.</p><p>In the United States, the Hot Club of Cowtown has been featured on All Things Considered, The Grand Ol' Opry, $40 Dollars a Day with Rachel Ray, Mountain Stage, A Prairie Home Companion, and numerous other radio and television programs. In the UK they have appeared extensively on BBC Radio with Bob Harris and Andy Kershaw, and on BBC TV's ""Later"" with Jools Holland, the ""Live From Glastonbury Festival"" broadcast, as well as throughout the UK at festivals, theatres, and clubs. Among the youngest members ever to be inducted into the Texas Western Swing Hall of Fame, in 2006 they also toured as musical ambassadors for the US State Department and were honored to be the first American band ever to tour in Azerbaijan. These days, tours with Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, the Mavericks and others keep the Hot Club of Cowtown busy dazzling new audiences both nationally and internationally throughout much of the year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,2278,An Evening with David Lindley,,,,http://www.davidlindley.com/,16108,"<h4><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><a href=""http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=1901"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #ffffff;""> </span></a></span></span></h4><p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><a href=""http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=1901"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #ffffff;""></span></a><span style=""color: #000000;""><img height=""25"" src=""http://jamminjava.com/ee-assets/gallery/artists/adult-artists/vip_sold_out_medium.jpg"" width=""150"" /> <strong></strong></span></span></span></p><p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""color: #ffffff;""><strong>(</strong><strong>special reserved, front row seat at a table)</strong></span><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><br /></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>David's legendary stringed-instrument virtuosity has been showcased on many of Browne's albums, beginning with 1973's For Everyman, and on classics such as Late For The Sky and The Pretender (the latter two both on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time). Browne also produced Lindley's 1983 LP, the acclaimed El Rayo-X.

The guys each decided to retire their childhood groups and instead come together to form Native in the Summer of 2007. The line up consists of Ed O'Neil /Guitar, Bobby Markos /Vocals and Bass, Dan Evans /Guitar and Nick Glassen on Drums. Since Native's inception they have self released the critically touted EP We, Delete Erase with many publications giving the disc accolades. CMJ remarked, ""The brand-new four piece, Native, is making noise even before their first full-length. Their self-released debut EP, We Delete; Erase, their fresh, confident sound is filling their listeners with hope for some great things to come."" Also, drawing comparisons to some pretty seminal bands Surfing Magazine described them as ""It lands somewhere between a pissed off Minus the Bear and a caged up Botch"".</p><p>Word of mouth about their live shows and their EP caught the attention of US Label and Management company Sargent House who went on to sign the band and who has since re-issued the EP. Native have continued to tour non-stop building quite a following in a short time through their unforgettable live shows and well executed musicianship. A review of their live show in St. Louis from The Riverfront Times stated ""There's something about the age-to-talent ratio that makes the post-punk of the barely legal Indiana quartet Native both impressive and genuine. Perhaps it's the group's intelligent guitar work, which recalls the geometric riffs of Jawbox and Faraquet- Or maybe it's the fact that the vocalist's yelps sound more like a pissed Ian MacKaye than a Warped Tour screamo outfit."" While Alternative Press' live show assessment was, "" For a band just a little more than a year old, Native play with the confidence and prowess of a group of lifers. ""</p><p>The early reviews in for their new full length album Wrestling Moves are no less flattering with Sputnik Music saying ""Anyone who has listened to We Delete; Erase will immediately hear the transformation within the band. Native is still Native, but the progression here is a massive one. ""</p><p>NATIVE's debut full length Wrestling Moves was released on January 23, 2010 on Sargent House. The album was Produced by Chris Common (These Arms Are Snakes, Pelican) at Red Room Studios in Seattle, WA.</p>",,,,,2271,"Ron Sexsmith ""Late Player Bloomer"" CD Release",http://www.myspace.com/ronsexsmith,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ron-Sexsmith/33844192632 ,http://www.youtube.com/OfficialRonSexsmith ,http://www.ronsexsmith.com/ ,11314,"<p>Ron Sexsmith is a major contemporary writer/artist who has amassed a sizable and consistently enthralling body of work since making his major label debut in 1995 with his self-titled album on Interscope, followed by such eloquent musical gems as Other Songs (1997), Blue Boy (2001), Retriever (2004) and Time Being (2006). Each has its own particular character but is connected to the rest by the overarching intelligence, impeccable taste and understated emotionality of this single-minded voice in the pop-cultural wilderness. As one new fan put it in a comment on iTunes, Sexsmith's music ""wins you over with a silk punch."" Well put.</p><p>On his ninth album, the cagily titled Exit Strategy of the Soul (with an emphasis on the last word of this provocative phrase), Sexsmith once again brings a provocative new wrinkle to his expansive aesthetic. Informed but not entrapped by soul and gospel music, ornamented by a Cuban horn section and his own gorgeously imperfect piano playing, the album achieves a sort of metaphysical dimension while maintaining breathtaking intimacy.</p><p>Working once again with Swedish-born, London-based producer Martin Terefe, who brought a burnished, Beatlesque lilt to Retriever, the artist finds an unexpected sweet spot in a stylistic and thematic realm he calls ""shadow gospel."" It's in full flower on such memorable songs as the horn-drenched ""This Is How I Know,"" the aching ""Hard Times,"" the playful ""Brandy Alexander"" (his first recorded co-write with fellow Canadian Leslie Feist) and the buoyantly humanistic ""Brighter Still."" Exit Strategy is framed by a pair of evocative instrumentals redolent of Randy Newman's film music, ""Spiritude"" and ""Dawn Anna."" It wouldn't be an overstatement to say that these 14 songs not only encompass the gamut of human emotions but do so with psychological acuity and plainspoken poetic grace.</p><p>The album finds Sexsmith at his most soulful-not that he sounds like Al Green. ""I don't have that kind of voice,"" he acknowledges, unnecessarily. ""'This Is How I Know' was the first song I wrote for the record,"" says Sexsmith, ""and it felt to me kind of like a gospel tune. As I continued writing, I started getting this vibe that there was a spiritual element to them. One song, &lsquo;Poor Helpless Dreams,' predates my first record; I tried recording it over the years and never got a version I was happy with, but lyrically it seemed to fit in with these new ones. &lsquo;Brighter Still' was lyrically very positive, and I felt the record needed that kind of song, which is sort of in a Bill Withers mode."" He pauses for an aside. ""I keep hoping he'll make another record someday.""</p><p>None of it was premeditated. ""When Martin and I go in the studio, we don't want to repeat ourselves,"" says Sexsmith. ""Retriever was a straight-ahead, '60-style pop album, and in a way this one is even more old-fashioned and rough. But the plan this time was to not have a plan. At the heart of it is some very questionable piano playing by me. The last bunch of records have been mostly written on piano, but when I'm working with Mitchell [From, the keyboard-playing veteran who produced Sexsmith's three Interscope album's and the previous Time Being], I don't really have the nerve to play in front of him. With Martin, I'd played one song on each record on piano, but with this one, I was determined to track the whole thing on piano, because that's how I'd been doing it at home, and at the core of the record, I thought it might be kind of cool to have an element that was kind of unpolished, and have the other musicians play around that. So that became the springboard for the sound of the record, with me banging away on the keys.""</p><p>The spirit of spontaneity extended to the lead vocals, although this aspect, too, was unplanned. ""Before the band came in,"" Sexsmith explains, "" I would record each song with guitar and voice, and then we'd get everyone in the room and we'd all play along to that-that's when I'd be banging away on piano. I never thought we'd wind up using the guide vocals, but when I went to New York to re-sing the whole record, even though I was singing everything technically better, the guide vocals had more personality. I still worried about it, but I love hearing Dylan records like that, where you can tell he's not getting too fussy about his singing, and I didn't want to get too precious about it.""</p><p>The album was near completion at Terefe's Kensaltown Studios in London when, out of the blue, the producer suggested a trip to Cuba to add a horn section. Though the players had been used by Terefe on a project with the Alex Cuba Band-Sexsmith even sang a duet with the bandleader on one track-the artist was initially nonplussed by the idea. But he'd had spent enough time in the studio with Terefe during the course of their three albums together to trust the producer's instincts, and so, with some trepidation, he went along with the idea. He wrote a song on the flight to Havana-which became the climactic ""Brighter Still,"" cut on the spot with a roomful of Cuban musicians.</p><p>""There's certainly nothing Cuban about my music,"" says Sexsmith with a laugh. ""When I heard the horn players running through the first song, I was thinking it was over the top. But when I heard the tracks back in New York, I was really excited; it was a whole other flavor, one that I've never had on a record before. So it didn't make sense to me at first, but now it really makes sense to me when I hear it."" Once again, Terefe's instincts were spot-on-because in going to Cuba, they'd somehow located Memphis circa 1968...and just maybe a half acre of heaven as well.</p><p>Here as always, Sexsmith's priority is the song itself. ""I want the lyric and the melody to be as flawless as possible,"" he says, ""so I'm always pretty critical of my own stuff. In general, I try to write songs that will stand up by themselves if I'm not there. My heroes are people who could write all different kinds of songs. Lennon could write something really powerful, and be really funny in the next song; Dylan the same way. I feel all sorts of things, and I want the songs to have different character traits.""</p><p>As he was writing the songs that would comprise Exit Strategy, Sexsmith realized that what he was feeling was somewhat headier than the psychological terrain he'd previously inhabited. ""It was exciting in a way,"" he recalls, ""because I was getting these lyrical ideas that were a bit different for me; they were reaching for something. I wouldn't call it poetry or anything, but I was trying for something that was a little more poetic. And I think that was partly inspired by what's going on in the world. There's something about writing on the piano, too-it has more of a gospel-y attitude, and it puts me in a different place.""</p><p>As for his place in the musical universe, Sexsmith says, ""Over the years, I've built it up to the point where I have a cult following, for lack of a better term. I don't have a huge following, but for the most part they're very into it. So that's encouraging, and that's really all you can ask for these days. When I got signed, I was already 30, so I never really expected to be filling arenas. I felt that what I was doing didn't really fit in with what I was hearing on the radio. That's why it always confuses me when I hear people saying, &lsquo;Why isn't Ron more famous?' It's not that I think a breakthrough album is out of the question, but it's such a mysterious thing. I mean, I just write the songs, and feel really lucky that I have a career.</p><p>""Recently I was in this bookstore,"" he continues, ""and I saw this giant encyclopedia of modern music. So I thought, &lsquo;Hmm... I wonder...' I open it up and, sure enough, there I am, right beside the Sex Pistols. So I suppose I have made a mark in my own way. What I can honestly say is that I'm proud of every single song that's ever been on one of my records. I'm not always proud of the production or the singing, but there's not a song that I couldn't play you now and not feel good about it.""</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fron-sexsmith%252Fid2931435%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,,,2265,Connor Christian & Southern Gothic,http://www.myspace.com/waitingforprincess,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Connor-Christian/22792502258?ref=search&sid=34101663.321597887..1,http://connorchristian.com/videos/,http://connorchristian.com/,8149,"<p>Equal parts modern troubadour, back road poet and outlaw rocker, Connor Christian creates gritty, soulful songs of experience revealing solace in hardship, hope in destitution, and a dustbowl sensibility.

""More than meets the eye"", ""Diamond in the rough"", ""Eye Candy"" all understatements. Words cant begin to describe the talent that is Ms. Lola Monroe formally known as ""Angel Lola Luv"". An exquisite mix of Ethiopian and Trinidadian, Lola has been blessed with an independent nature, street smarts a keen business sense and beauty. Born in Ethiopia, raised in Washington DC's Garfield Terrace, there was nothing glamorous about her upbringing. No stranger to struggle Lola has been hustling to provide for herself since the age of 15.</p><p>Taking the Modeling industry by storm in 2006 after a chance meeting with Photographer Mike Styles Business partner of her current Manager Michelle Vieyra. Lola quickly became the most sought after Video Model. Visually stimulating the public eye appearing in high profile videos for 50 Cent, Kanye West, Trey Songz, Busta Rhymes and the list goes on. In addition, Lola appeared on the cover of numerous major magazine publications and made history by taking the ""Eye Candy of the Year"" title two years consecutively. Determined and driven, Lola made her acting debut in the Wendy Williams biopic ""Queen of Media"" later she starred in ""Crazy like a fox"". She then went on to play a role in ""Before I Self Destruct"" a film written and directed by Curtis Jackson.</p><p>""Angel Lola Luv"" was a persona created for the modeling aspect of her career. In 2007 Lola retired from video modeling and officially and exclusively transitioned into Lola Monroe the Rapper/Entertainer. The ""Monroe"" is directly related to the iconic Actress, Model, Film Producer and Singer Marilyn Monroe. Due to the fact the two share a similar story, were discovered in the same fashion and used modeling as a entry to further their career in the Entertainment Industry. The name Lola Monroe defines who she is and who she has always been, her personality and true character.</p><p>At the age of 12 Lola began writing poems and songs, using music as an escapism and a form of expression. Lola Monroe's musical influences include Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Lil Wayne, Tupac, Eminem, MC Lite, Queen Latifah, Salt n Pepa, Lil Kim, Trina, and Foxy Brown. Lola describes her music as ""painting a vivid picture of my experiences, my views and my feelings towards the struggle. The grind, love, money, hate, anything the streets can feel from my perspective"". When you listen to Lola Monroe's music it is obvious she is writing from a genuine place and speaking on real life situations and personal experiences that both men and women can relate to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,2256,The Pretty Reckless,http://www.myspace.com/theprettyyreckless,http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/pages/The-Pretty-Reckless/103740997526?ref=ts,http://www.theprettyreckless.com/media/,http://www.theprettyreckless.com/splash/,8117,"<p>One night several years ago, Taylor Momsen's father took his daughter to a White Stripes show. ""Before that, the only concert I'd been to was Britney Spears,"" says the singer, songwriter, and guitarist. ""But once I saw Jack White onstage, that was it. I grew up as a dancer and I thought you had to dance to be a girl in the music industry. Then I saw the White Stripes and I was like, &lsquo;No, you don't. I can do that.'"" Momsen was nine.</p><p>Jack White's raw power and deceptively simple guitar-and-vocal attack proved to be highly influential on the now 16-year-old Momsen, who began humming melodies before she could talk and writing songs at the age of five after falling in love with The Beatles. ""I was obsessed with them,"" she says. ""I also loved Led Zeppelin, The Who, Pink Floyd, Audioslave, Soundgarden, Oasis, and Nirvana. That's what I listened to. My rock idols are all men.""</p><p>So it's not surprising that Momsen channels a lot of masculine energy on LIGHT ME UP, her rock-and-roll-heroine-in-the-making debut album with her band The Pretty Reckless. The songs, all written by Momsen and Ben Phillips with their producer Kato Khandwala, run the gamut of emotions, alternating at times between seething rage and a bruised vulnerability. With Momsen's inky vocals, pummeling riffs, and swaggering attitude, LIGHT ME UP sounds a bit like what might have happened had Led Zeppelin been fronted by ""a chick.""  The album's ferocity could raise an eyebrow from those expecting a pretty, blonde teenager to gravitate toward straight-up pop songwriting. ""It's heavier than people might expect from me,"" says Momsen, who is best known as the actress who plays Jenny Humphrey on The CW's Gossip Girl. ""But this album is the most honest expression of who I truly am.""</p><p>Momsen is a smart, emotionally complex young woman who has developed a strong identity despite growing up in the notoriously critical and fickle entertainment industry. Born and raised in St. Louis, MO, Taylor spent much of her time in NYC and at thirteen, she relocated to Manhattan. At two years old, Momsen signed to a modeling agency and a year later she began acting professionally appearing in commercials as well as films such as The Grinch Who Stole Christmas. In 2007 Momsen was cast as a lead in the CW show Gossip Girl.</p><p>""I didn't choose acting or modeling, I got thrown into it,"" Momsen says. ""I liked it, so that wasn't a problem, but music and songwriting are what I've always really wanted to do. I've been working with producers and hanging out in recording studios since I was five, I just couldn't put out an album when I was eight,"" she says with a laugh. ""Now I can.""</p><p>LIGHT ME UP is an unflinchingly honest chronicle of Momsen's experiences, filtered through her unique point of view. ""The record is about life,"" she says. ""It covers everything: love, death, and music itself. It's rock and roll. It's sex. It's drugs. It's religion. It's politics. Each song tells a story about the trials and tribulations and emotional struggles that I've experienced or observed. It's not a happy pop record, but it's not Satan-worshiping either. The lyrics aren't meant to be taken literally, they are open to interpretation.""</p><p>The songs tackle everything from romantic insecurity (the full-throttle rager ""Make Me Wanna Die,"" which also appears on the soundtrack to the film Kick-Ass), to despair (""You""), to how working non-stop can you make you feel like one of the un-dead (""Zombie""). Momsen pushes back against the haters on ""Light Me Up"" and asks how far you have to go to get forgiveness on ""Going Down."" With her growly, world-weary alto, Momsen can do it all: garage-rock rave-ups (""Miss Nothing""), punchy blues-rock stompers (""My Medicine,"" ""Since You're Gone""), as well as emotional power ballads (""Just Tonight"") and lovely acoustic guitar and string-driven numbers (""You"").</p><p>""I'm not just writing something because I think people might like it,"" Momsen says. ""I hope they do, but I'm writing it because I have something to say. So many feelings go into the lyrics that it's hard to explain what they're about. Momsen first hooked up with Khandwala (Blondie, Drowning Pool, Paramore, Breaking Benjamin) and partner and songwriter, Phillips in October 2008.  By the spring of last year, they felt they had hit upon a sound that felt authentic to her.</p><p>""The three of us have similar musical taste, so it was easy to find that singular vision,"" Phillips says. ""Kato and I worked very hard to help Taylor reach her potential because we could see how talented she was right off the bat. She went into the vocal booth and began to sing and we turned to each other and went, &lsquo;Holy sh*t, she's f**'ing great.' Her voice was astonishing. So many artists these days let their voices be discombobulated by computers. Taylor doesn't do that. She doesn't need to. She can walk into a room and kick your ass.""</p>",,,,,2252,Robbie Schaefer (from Eddie From Ohio),,,,http://www.robbieschaefer.com/,0,"<p>Robbie Schaefer's Mom Thinks He's Really Great-In case you haven't spoken with her lately, Robbie Schaefer is the guitarist and songwriter for the acclaimed independent folk/rock band Eddie From Ohio. Although the indie model has become increasingly common in the music industry, Eddie From Ohio actually helped pave the way, building a fan base through relentless touring and grassroots marketing beginning in 1991. Having created a large and loyal following across the U.S. and Canada (the mailing list now tops 25,000 names), the band has also released 9 CDs, selling upwards of 150,000 copies, all on their own Virginia Soul Records.</p><p>In recent years Robbie has also turned his musical attention toward solo projects, (releasing In The Flesh, a live solo album, in 2003), composing and recording the theme song for the theatrical production Gulf View Drive (by New York playwright Arlene Hutton), which premiered at the Actor's Co-Op in Hollywood, CA in 2006, and releasing his first cd for kids and families, Songs For Kids Like Us on Rocket Pop Records in 2006. The success of  Songs For Kids Like Us  led to a wealth of opportunities for Robbie, culminating in his arrival as Music Director at XMKiDS on XM Satellite Radio. His show, ""Robbie Schaefer's Stuck In A Real Tall Tree"", airs Monday-Thursday 7pmEST/4pmPST and Saturday 10amEST/7amPST.</p><p>Lastly, Robbie Schaefer's Mom would like you to know that his favorite color is red, his favorite food is sushi, he's really into yoga and all that woo-woo spiritual stuff, has excellent hygiene, and an affinity for olives and espresso that borders on the abnormal. Oh, and he just adores it when she yells ""I love you Robbie"" at his shows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,2245,Project/Object Featuring IKE WILLIS,,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu4ghqF70sI,

on Fall Northeast Tour</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Frank Zappa is one of the Twentieth Century's most important composers.  His effect on the modern music landscape is undeniable.  Formed in the early Nineties, Project/Object is on a mission to bring this music to the masses by faithfully recreating the live Zappa experience.  They have performed over the years with at least fifteen of Zappa's well-known alumni. In every new market they visit, Project/Object pleases the Zappa connoisseurs and converts the curious into dedicated fans.  In 2011 the band will be joined by original Zappa band mate Ike Willis(voice of Joe), who toured and recorded with Zappa from 1976-1988.  Project/Object's collaboration with Willis and White is a testament to the bands desire to present a classic era of Zappa's music as it was recorded while also developing creativity in live performance.</p>",,,,,2242,Musical Tribute to Jim Tucker (1962-2010) featuring The Lost Highway Band + Laurie Jones & SB2 + MHR,http://www.myspace.com/losthwyband,,,,8040,"<p>Lost Highway Band brand of music consists of rock and roll, with a swamp feel and a country edge.</p>",,,,,2236,Jay Nash CD Release + Natalia Zukerman + Garrison Starr,http://www.myspace.com/jaynash,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jay-Nash/21982616669#!/pages/Jay-Nash/21982616669?v=info,http://www.youtube.com/user/jaynashmusic,http://www.jaynash.com/,8017,"<p>Jay Nash, Californian native and rock troubadour, has been blessed with the kind of excruciatingly rustic voice so rarely heard on record. Coupled with that is his unnervingly candid approach to song-writing - the man is a burgeoning talent set for realisation with his latest studio release &lsquo;The Things You Think You Need'.</p><p>It's certainly refreshing to find an artist that refuses to simply dwell on the hard times, instead choosing to bask in the good and the great that life has to offer. At times almost jovial, Nash's charisma and buoyant attitude is infectious to the last with a sound capable of softening the sternest of hearts.</p><p>From the resplendent urgency of &lsquo;Hard Lesson' to the elegiac &lsquo;Barcelona', &lsquo;The Things You Think You Need' has the potential to surpass anything that's gone before. The writing/recording process for this, his fourth studio album, saw Nash's creative spark ignite like wild-fire as he wrestled with the concept of producing an album laden with variety and character.</p><p>By drawing inspiration from his own life experiences, both past and present, Nash's inspirational and evocative lyrical imagery possesses the ability to shatter those deep-rooted inadequacies and musters a feeling of liberation and new-found confidence. There's no sign of an agenda here - Nash's spirited folk revival offers salvation for the masses.</p><p>Too many of today's artists find it easy to trade on a manufactured kinship - creating an unsettling, short-term bond with audiences that they're all too willing to discard on a whim. Jay Nash is a different animal altogether and his desire to connect with people is evident as he produces that very first subtle, Americana-style chord.</p><p>There's no bravado, no ill-placed audacity. Nash, its plain to see, is one of us - one of the good guys. A trailblazer for passion and hard graft - a man who knows no limitation.</p>",,,,,2231,Fat Trel,http://www.myspace.com/fattrel,,,,7983,,,,,,2226,Along Those Lines,http://www.myspace.com/alongthoselinesmusic,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Along-Those-Lines/174704933472,http://www.youtube.com/somethingATL,http://alongthoselinesmusic.com/,12778,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;""> </span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Late show!

After solidifying the line up in June 2007 with lead guitarist Will Trenum and bass player Isaac Shields, ATL was created. Drummer, Jared Dumale was later added in February of 2009. The four piece from Washington, D.C. take pride on having a live show that is unforgettable as well as the work ethic needed to succeed. You will NOT find a harder working band or a more dedicated group of guys. Come to a show and see why they have developed a buzz. 2010 has been the year for Along Those Lines!

It's all about those deep-running connections that make him what he is-those unbreakable links between artist and audience, between styles of music, between art and life, and most of all, between all people. As Cas points out, reggae's core message is, after all, ""one love.""</p><p>His crystalline voice and funky, easygoing beats earned Cas a second-place finish on ""America's Got Talent,"" which in turn netted him a measure of fame and a following. But the contest also locked the Texan singer/songwriter/guitarist into a major label deal that didn't feel right. So, not wanting to be turned into a manufactured product, he struck out on his own. The superb result: ""Connection,"" a collection of songs basking in the philosophical and musical maturity that comes from staying true to his artistic vision.</p><p>Raised by musician parents, Cas grew up surrounded by the sounds of blues and 60s-70s rock. He got serious about the guitar at age 12 and was ""taught by the tribe"" of musicians passing through the house. ""The kitchen would be turned into the practice room or for jam sessions, so I was pretty much born into that lifestyle,"" he says. And from the very beginning he was more inclined to create his own music than to slavishly learn covers.</p><p>Also prominent at home were the Bob Marley records his mother would play, which made a profound impression. After a period of heavy immersion in the sounds of the ska/punk/skateboard culture, Cas was blown away by the classic reggae-pop of bands like UB40 and Sublime, and his mature style began to take shape.</p><p>Those pop-inflected island grooves and his joyful, versatile voice helped bring Cas to the brink of stardom on ""America's Got Talent"" and sell 30,000 copies of a debut album with virtually no promotion. And they're fundamental to the soul of his music-what he calls the ""relaxing, effortless playing where everything fits together."" Elements of soul, blues, and pop swirl through Cas's strong reggae beats. Just like disparate musical styles, ""we're way more connected than we think,"" Cas says. ""We separate ourselves in so many different ways, but the whole theme of the album is that we're all connected.""</p><p>""Every color,"" he sings in the title track, ""is created from the same light.""</p><p>Easy Star, the leading U.S.-based independent reggae label, is the ideal home for ""Connection."" The label has been stretching beyond its strictly roots-reggae format, signing progressive bands and artists like John Brown's Body, Tommy T, and The Black Seeds. ""Cas's sound is unique, accessible, and a great way to keep expanding the Easy Star audience,"" says CEO Eric Smith. ""And it's not often we come across a singer-songwriter this talented, regardless of genre, so we had to work with Cas.""</p><p>Mixed by Danny Kalb (Ben Harper, Beck), ""Connection"" bristles with chill grooves, rocking guitars, and funky horns, all fueling Cas's irresistible melodies. Meanwhile his lyrics effortlessly balance simple, spiritual truths with thoughtful reflection. Cas's songs recognize the complexities of life-love, family, worldly troubles and uncertainties-but always come back to the central message of connection.</p><p>It's the journey that matters; Cas is aiming for success on his own terms. ""If I'm not doing it authentically then I don't want it,"" he says. His only goal: ""To authentically express myself and help others do the same. Because it's a sweet life to be able to do that.""</p>",,,,,2222,Dj Matheus + 5ive + Keep it Terror + Forever The Win,http://www.myspace.com/djmatheus,,,,7967,"<p><a

of four members: J.T. Gray on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Chris Baella on lead guitar, Zach Bonner on bass and backing vocals, and Jared Hornaday on drums Fusing elements of hard rock, alternative, and metal, ZeroShift has created a sound that is familiar yet uniquely their own. The stage presence that ZeroShift presents consistently at every show is one of the many assets of the band. As a vocalist, J.T. Gray has a way of reaching out to the audience at every show and making each person in attendance feel as though the show is personalized just for them. Their lyrics are full of hidden meanings and subtle references that allow the audience to apply them directly to their own lives, engaging them in a way that only a truly talented band can.</p>",,,,,2213,David Berkeley,http://www.myspace.com/davidberkeley,http://www.facebook.com/davidberkeleymusic,http://www.youtube.com/user/berkeleydavid,http://www.davidberkeley.com/,0,"<!--[if

will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">David Berkeley is a romantic realist, known for his ability to look at the human condition in all its complexity and give us luminous songs full of sunshine and anguish, melancholy and delight. He brings the people and situations he sings about to vibrant life with a warm, rich tenor that often slips into an aching falsetto to underline the overwhelming emotions that can move us to tears or laughter. On Some Kind of Cure, his fourth studio album, Berkeley delivers some of his most heartfelt tunes blending folk, rock, and classic pop to create timeless expressions of love and longing.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;The majority of songs on Some Kind of Cure were written while Berkeley and his family were living in a remote 35-person village in the mountains of Corsica. The silence and wild island landscapes seeped into Berkeley&rsquo;s soul, bringing forth a collection of lingering beauty. &ldquo;There were no stores in our tiny town,&rdquo; Berkeley explained. &ldquo;No cafes. No post office. No Internet. It was silent. I had very few distractions, which was quite different from life in a big city. Because no one spoke English, I could sing rough drafts of lyrics without being embarrassed. When I played songs for the villagers, I had to make sure the emotion came through in the music, as well as the words. That had a big effect on the way I wrote my songs.&rdquo;</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Berkeley recorded the album after returning to the States, working in Atlanta with producer Will Robertson. The project was entirely funded by Berkeley&rsquo;s fans. &ldquo;We took our time making this record. We went through the lyrics, almost line by line, translating words into music and emotion.&rdquo; The core band for the project was Robertson on piano and bass; drummer Kevin O&rsquo;Donnell (Andrew Bird); Kim Taylor (Over the Rhine) on background vocals; Jordan Katz (De La Soul, Sara Bareilles) on banjo and horns; and Lex Price (Mindy Smith) on mandolin and guitars. Most tracks were cut in the studio with Berkeley singing and playing guitar live while Will played piano or bass. &ldquo;The recording has a lot of breadth and a natural, relaxed feel,&rdquo; Berkeley explains. &ldquo;It sounds more like I do in concert than my previous recordings.&rsquo;</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;&ldquo;The best of the young American songwriters, a voice full of feeling and a big, big heart. And the balls to say what he thinks.&rdquo; - Boston Phoenix</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">The words and music on Some Kind of Cure capture a wide range of emotion, employing shifting tempos, a dynamic range and diverse arrangements that suggest traditional folk, British Invasion pop, and rock. &ldquo;George Square&rdquo; opens the album with its subtle cinematic arrangement. Berkeley&rsquo;s hushed staccato vocal and Robertson&rsquo;s distorted Rhodes create a delicious tension that&rsquo;s resolved by the soaring</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">strings that lift the last verse to the clouds with Jordan Katz playing an almost subliminal trumpet line to hold the song together. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a relationship song,&rdquo; Berkeley says. &ldquo;Love is the solution, but the resolution is often deeper and more mysterious than we know.&rdquo; The tinny sound of music coming through an old fashion car radio sets up &ldquo;Parachute,&rdquo; a bright, bouncy rocker with an irresistible chorus. The voices of Berkeley and Kim Taylor dance through the mix like hesitant lovers, finally coming together in celebratory harmony for the hook: &ldquo;Your heart is like a parachute, it only opens when you fall.&rdquo;</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Peter Bradley Adams adds subtle piano accents to &ldquo;The Blood and the Wine,&rdquo; a quiet love song Berkeley wrote for his wife. It&rsquo;s one of Berkeley&rsquo;s most intimate vocals and shows off his remarkable range as it shifts from a low vulnerable whisper to a wordless, plaintive falsetto on the chorus to express a sense of emotional fragility. The song&rsquo;s intricate lyrics, sophisticated rhymes and overlapping images use simple language to convey love&rsquo;s emotional complexity. Katz adds a sense of poignant yearning to the track with his melancholy&nbsp; flugelhorn.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">The dark, sparse opening of &ldquo;Hope for Better Days&rdquo; slowly builds to a rousing rocking climax, ending with a vocal round that is tough not to sing along to. &ldquo;Shenandoah&rdquo; is a timeless frontier ballad; understated piano and electric guitar and the close harmonies of Berkeley and Taylor underscore the song&rsquo;s gentle beauty. The album closes with &ldquo;Winter Winds,&rdquo; a song that imagines a father&rsquo;s deathbed conversation with his son. A simple, repeating melody keeps your attention on Berkeley&rsquo;s aching vocal singing a heartbreaking lyric, sounding more and more desperate as the song draws to a close, echoing the father&rsquo;s reluctance to leave this life. Ominous strings and woodwinds rise up to intensify the song&rsquo;s drama, then fade away leaving Berkeley and his acoustic guitar alone to deliver the final benediction.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Some Kind of Cure shows Berkeley at his best, delivering songs marked by warm, rolling melodies, fervent lyrics and his genuine desire to connect with his audience and his own soul. &ldquo;I work long and hard on every song,&rdquo; Berkeley explains. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t write throw away lines; there&rsquo;s a reason for every word in every song. Will did an amazing job finding the essence of these songs and layering the arrangements to create a sensual landscape that does each piece justice.&rdquo;</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;Dashing singer-songwriter David Berkeley delivers his warm, thoughtful songs, along with a reliably hilarious line in onstage banter.&rdquo; - Time Out New York</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;In concert, Berkeley wins crowds over with his low-key charisma and hilarious between song banter. He usually introduces songs with long, intricate anecdotes and branching commentaries, using a manner that&rsquo;s more front porch than show biz, relaxing people without any apparent effort to be funny, a difficult balance to achieve. He weaves together fact, fiction and hyperbole into stories that often leave</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">audiences in hysterics without resorting to obvious punch lines. His on stage narratives rarely repeat themselves and are full of the same astutely observed details that propel his songs.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">As you might expect from his witty and erudite stage patter, Berkeley is a talented prose writer. He kept a diary of his stay on Corsica, which became the basis of his accompanying book, 140 Goats and A Guitar: The Stories Behind Some Kind of Cure . Like his songs, the stories are well-constructed pieces filled with revealing details and poetic language. Berkeley's concept is a unique one: The book will</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">include a download code for the album, and readers are encouraged to move through the book reading each story and then listening to the corresponding song. Berkeley explains, ""The stories give you a look behind all the songs on the record. I often tell stories that explain a song or that led to a song. When I got back from Corsica, I realized that many of the songs were created out of situations and events--some</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">funny, some awkward, some painful."" He writes these stories with an openness and honesty that matches his music. ""Ultimately, I believe my music conjures an eerie optimism, a mysterious kind of hope,"" Berkeley says. ""I think that sentiment hovers over most of the album and most of the book.&rdquo;</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">David Berkeley never intended to become a professional musician. &ldquo;I sang all the time, almost before I could talk,&rdquo; Berkeley recalls. &ldquo;My parents didn&rsquo;t take me to anything like Star Search performances, but they did take me to New York a lot to see Broadway shows. I had a good ear and could remember the words and melodies to the songs I liked, but I didn&rsquo;t start playing music myself until fairly late.&rdquo;</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Berkeley grew up in New Jersey. He usually took the lead in class musicals, but he&rsquo;s modest about his early success. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that was a formative experience. I started on guitar when I was 15, like a lot of teenagers, mostly to get girls. I was happy singing other people&rsquo;s music, greats like Neil Young; Crosby, Stills and Nash; the Grateful Dead and other California sounds. I loved Paul Simon&rsquo;s lyrics, but my chops weren&rsquo;t that good. They still aren&rsquo;t. I do have a style, but I&rsquo;m a singer before I&rsquo;m a guitarist.&rdquo;</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Berkeley played in various bands in high school and during his years at Harvard, where he studied philosophy and literature. He busked in Harvard Square, but he didn&rsquo;t get serious about music until he fell in love. &ldquo;I started writing songs in my last years of college, when I had my heart broken. My first songs were written in an attempt to get my girlfriend back. I ultimately did, and married her, but it took a while.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&ldquo;When I graduated, I wanted to be a travel writer. One summer, I went to Alaska and wrote for Let&rsquo;s Go Alaska. I worked five summers as a whitewater rafting guide in Idaho. After college, I moved to Santa Fe to work for Outside magazine. While I was there, I managed a band and that got me excited about the music business. By the time they broke up, I&rsquo;d amassed a lot of songs and wanted to make a record. I decided I wanted to be onstage, not backstage.&rdquo;</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;Berkeley recorded his first album, The Confluence, in the fall of 2001. He started playing live to support the album, working days as a teacher in a public school in Brooklyn. &ldquo;I was allegedly teaching creative writing, but mainly I tried to control the kids and not get hurt. I played shows on nights and weekends.&rdquo;</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Berkeley&rsquo;s second album, 2004&rsquo;s After The Wrecking Ships, featured &ldquo;Fire Sign."" The next year, Berkeley made Live From Fez, recorded at his favorite club just before it closed, but working day and night was taking its toll. &ldquo;I was losing my voice and exhausted. I decided I had to do music full time.""</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Berkeley&rsquo;s music started getting national attention when a producer of the CBS drama Without a Trace saw him play live. Berkeley wrote &ldquo;Fire Sign&rdquo; for the show and went on to perform on World Caf&eacute;, Mountain Stage, XM&rsquo;s Loft Sessions and radio stations across the country. He has toured in support of Dido, Don Mclean, Billy Bragg, Ray Lamontagne, Rufus Wainwright, Ben Folds, Nickel Creek and many more. He received ASCAP&rsquo;s Johnny Mercer Songwriter Award and, perhaps most notably, performed on PRI&rsquo;s This American Life, telling the awkward and hilarious story of a private serenade he was hired to perform to help a guy win back an ex-girlfriend.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Berkeley moved from New York to Atlanta &ldquo;so my wife could go to grad school. We survived on my wife&rsquo;s stipend and record sales.&rdquo; While living in Atlanta, Berkeley wrote the songs for Strange Light (2008), which he recorded in Chicago with producer Brian Deck (Iron &amp; Wine, Modest Mouse). While there, Berkeley started the ATL Collective, an organization of local musicians that put on productions that recreated classic albums with food or beverage hooks. &ldquo;We did Johnny Cash&rsquo;s Live at Folsom Prison with prison food (grits and refried beans served on cardboard). We had bloody marys for Blood on the Tracks. We did Dr. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The shows are still going on in Atlanta, and hopefully I'll start doing them in the San Francisco Bay Area as well.&rdquo;</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Berkeley relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area with his young family after returning to the States and will be touring nationally to support the album.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Though unexpected, Berkeley&rsquo;s music has also made its way to the world of dance music. Club remixes of his ""Fire Sign"" have attracted the attention of major DJs like Tiesto, Sean Tyas, and Pedro Del Mar, and Berkeley has begun collaborating to create new original dance music with his signature vocals.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Some Kind of Cure showcases Berkeley&rsquo;s melodic and lyrical gifts, but the album is held together by his unique, expressive voice. &ldquo;I was singing almost before I could speak,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more natural singing than I am doing anything else.&rdquo; His ease is apparent as his vocals glide from a warm, high baritone to a rich full tenor, sometimes slipping into an aching falsetto. &ldquo;It may be pop music, but my goal is to be open and honest. I&rsquo;m not afraid to show fear and weakness. I want my songs to convey hope without denying the hard times we all face.&rdquo;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/david-berkeley/id5929114?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/davidberkeley,,2211,The Downtown Fiction,http://myspace.com/thedowntownfiction,http://www.facebook.com/thedowntownfiction,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUgfKyLnSK0&feature=player_embedded,http://www.thedowntownfiction.com/,11674,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Early Show! This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Downtown Fiction (TDF) of Fairfax, Virginia have taken their love of music, friends, and a darn good time and created something really special. Citing influences ranging from Green Day to The Rolling Stones, the pop-rock trio has a sound comparable to the likes of Jimmy Eat World, Blink 182, and The All-American Rejects. On March 3rd, 2010, TDF released their first EP ""Best I Never Had"" to a long climb up the iTunes chart. With a blossoming number of dedicated followers on multiple social networking sites and a YouTube channel currently boasting 5,000 subscribers and surpassing a whopping 1,000,000 views, TDF is well on their way to taking over the media world.</p><p>The Downtown Fiction has been building a reputation for working hard and touring constantly alongside their contemporaries; making appearances on this past summer's Bamboozle Road Show with headliners Boys Like Girls and All Time Low, as well as the 2010 Vans Warped Tour. With a loyal fan base that just keeps growing, TDF has created a perfect experience for their fans and for music lovers everywhere, providing an entertaining live show in addition to their high-energy music. And not only has The Downtown Fiction made it their goal to road trip across America with their catchy tunes, but they've also made a point to travel the globe; hitting up Japan in the fall of 2010 with We The Kings before embarking on a full US tour as the main supporting act with The Summer Set.</p><p>In addition to their world travels, (including rocking cities with The Ready Set on the Glamour Kills Tour) and popularity-gaining EP's, TDF's music has been circling the world in another form - by being featured on some of the most popular TV shows around. Besides their debut video for ""I Just Wanna Run"" premiering on MTV Hits, MTV2, and MTV U; their music can be heard throughout the second season of MTV's Jersey Shore, and has been featured on other shows like The Hard Times of RJ Berger, The Challenge: Fresh Meat II, The Hills, and Keeping Up With The Kardashians. With fans across America and even in South Asia, TDF proves to be on a musical mission.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Originally started by two brothers -- Jared and Marshall Cunningham -- ""Sing Me Insomnia"" (SMI) began their journey as an acoustic duo, playing guitar and keyboard while sharing vocal duties. Simultaneously, Jared was creating musical bliss with Wes Beale, who was skilled on both lead guitar and bass. Soon after, it only made sense to transform the acoustic partnership into a full band, and with the addition of Jordan Depriest on drums, the group has found it's niche in the Northern Virginia music scene. Sing Me Insomnia creates each and every note with equal parts passion and talent. Despite their popularity coming with ease, this band is one of the hardest working and determined groups out there. With a large fan base of loyal music lovers (appropriately dubbed ""The Insomniacs""), SMI has gained their own following and continues to progress with the hopes and dreams of spreading their love for music to as many people as possible.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Sing Me Insomnia</span> <a href=""http://www.singmeinsomnia.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/singmeinsomnia"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/singmeinsomnia"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sing-Me-Insomnia/69167380988?ref=ts"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/sing-me-insomnia/id302946686?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/SingMeInsomnia"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-downtown-fiction/id304215792?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/downtownfiction,,2208,Bands without Borders Featuring:Brother Shamus,http://www.myspace.com/brothershamus,,,http://brothershamusmusic.com/intropage.cfm,7813,"<p>M. Todd Miller (lead vocals, guitar)<br />Michael &ldquo;Todd&rdquo; Miller was born January 5, 1974 and has lived in the Northern Virginia area ever since. He started playing drums and guitar at age 13. At age 18, Todd started playing professionally in clubs and bars in the DC Metropolitan area, in some cases using fake identification when necessary. Though being a drummer, Todd has always been a lyricist/songwriter for each of his projects: (Flood Thought, Bunsen Honeydew, and Lamont). Todd has also played and/or recorded with other projects such as: (Lucky Dog, Mike Holden, Steve Hagadorn, Claire Gilbride, The Pharmacy Profits, and April Park Theory). Brother Shamus is the first project that he has been the guitarist/front man for - now playing and singing the songs he has written. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much more natural to sing and play songs you&rsquo;ve written yourself as opposed to trying to write for someone else and/or trying to &lsquo;feel&rsquo; what someone else has written for you. Brother Shamus allows me, for the first time, to completely be myself style-wise, the way I am. So that&rsquo;s it. All you&rsquo;re going to get. Hope you enjoy.&rdquo; His influences include Tom Waits, Otis Redding, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Thelonius Monk, Tom Petty, and Medeski, Martin, and Wood. <br /><br />James Main (percussion, vocals)<br />In 1995, James Main relocated to Arlington, VA from New England to join the band Bunsen Honeydew; this is when he and Todd Miller began playing music together. After a year (Bunsen Honeydew had ended), Main helped form another indie/punk bank Luka Brazzi. In 1999, Main left Luka Brazzi and joined Miller full-time in the acid/funk band Lamont, which was together for 7 years. Lamont released their record &ldquo;Rooster Rickshaw&rdquo; in 2000, around the same time Main joined Miller and bassist Rich de los Reyes in the funky party band Lucky Dog. In early 2001, Lucky Dog became the house band at Madam&rsquo;s Organ, a popular DC music venue. In early 2004, with Lucky Dog on an extended hiatus and Lamont disbanded, Main and Miller began rehearsing several songs written by Miller. Rich De los Reyes and Eddie Hartness joined the duo 3 months later and Brother Shamus was formed. Along with playing in Brother Shamus, Main continues to play in Lucky Dog and the occasional Lamont reunion. <br /><br /><br />Aaron Keener (guitar)<br />Aaron Anthony Keener&rsquo;s interest in the guitar began when he was a child, and upon receiving his first guitar at 14, he was hooked. He taught himself the guitar, listening to the greats and eventually made his way into local bands in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. His calling lead him to study music at McLennan Community College in Waco, Texas, where he earned two degrees in three years, graduating in May of 2000: Associate of Arts and Sciences in Music Performance and Associate of Arts and Sciences in Audio Production. While attending McLennan, he also began to teach at local music shops and was a member of the Jacob Jiles Band, which performed all over Texas and was heard on radio and TV. After graduating, Aaron worked as an engineer and session musician for recording studios in Texas alongside Grammy winning musicians. He also continued to teach at performing arts schools. In 2005, Aaron began teaching independently, at his home studio, and continued playing in local bands. In 2006, Wiseguy, a trio for which Aaron played lead guitar, was granted the prestigious award of Best Band of the Bay in Houston, Texas. In August of 2006, Aaron moved to Arlington, Virginia, where he continues to record and teach music.</p>",,,,,2206,Tracy Grammer,,http://www.facebook.com/pages/tracy-grammer-music/170774377155,,http://www.tracygrammer.com/,17225,"<p>Folk music authority Andrew Calhoun of Waterbug Records comments: ""No one sings Dave Carter's songs better than Tracy. He chose her to be the voice of his songs. His vision, their vision, was that they shared something they both saw. She is half the reason why they were great.""</p><p>Grammer is toured in support of FLOWER OF AVALON (Signature Sounds 2005), her much anticipated solo debut. In January 2006, that album showed up on ""Best of"" lists and listener polls around the country, and was the #1 most-played album on folk radio across the United States for 2005. We call this a triumph -- a testament to the enduring appeal of Carter's songwriting, and a sign of good things to come for Grammer as she continues on her solo career.&nbsp;Flower of Avalon includes nine previously-unreleased songs by the late Dave Carter and one traditional tune, re-worked by Oregon professor Wm. Jolliff. Multi-tasking masterfully as co-producer, singer, and multi-instrumentalist, Grammer digs deep into the spirit of Carter's poetic verses and haunting melodies to color each song with textures and flourishes that blur the boundaries of categorization. Paired with Grammer's voice -- emotive, warm and versatile -- the songs on Flower of Avalon are nothing less than visionary. Mary Chapin Carpenter sings harmony on three cuts and wrote the liner notes for the record. Carpenter writes, ""Tracy's continuing quest to make sure that the world remembers Dave Carter marks a new beginning of artistry for her. We are lucky that she is so brave, generous and gifted."" Flower of Avalon is produced by Grammer and John Jennings (Mary Chapin Carpenter, Indigo Girls).</p><p>Tracy Grammer tours internationally with songwriter/multi-instrumentalist Jim Henry (Deb Talan, Mark Erelli, The Burns Sisters). With acoustic and electric guitars, beautifully matched voices, dobro, mandolin and violin, this duo shares original songs, instrumentals, and pays homage to Carter and other stellar writers while charting a brand new course for themselves in the musical landscape. Grammer says, ""I'll keep on singing, and I'll keep on telling my story, however that evolves. Working with Dave Carter was the first step on what I hope is going to be a long and fruitful road for me: the endless quest for authenticity through music.""</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Ftracy-grammer%252Fid69284957%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/tracygrammer,,2203,All You Need Is Love 2 - Jammin' Java's Songwriters' circle - A Tribute To The Beatles & Love Songs,http://www.myspace.com/jamminjavasongwritercircle,,,,8128,"<p>Are you in love, looking for love, or scorning love?

She'd move back to Brooklyn, after spending three years in Los Angeles, had fallen in love and gotten married, and watched as the record industry cease to exist.  ""I had no idea how or when I was going to make my next record, let alone release one,"" says Bonham. ""I started writing and it took shape organically."" Bonham got together with guitarist Smokey Hormel (Tom Waits, Beck, Rufus Wainwright) and his ""Roundup"" trio in a Brooklyn studio and began cutting tracks that reflected the changes in her life in an honest, open way.</p><p>As on past efforts, romance, love and heartache make their appearance, but where Bonham's early vocal efforts displayed a rebellious snarl, the singer nowadays takes a softer, if no less direct, approach. Her wry wit, however, remains, conjuring up a mix of humor and despair on ""Reciprocal Feelings"": ""I'd like to be my own best friend/Turns out there's no reciprocal feelings/What a total snob.""</p><p>A native of Eugene, OR, Bonham began singing at age five, playing the violin at nine and piano at age 14. After earning a violin scholarship at University of Southern California, she transferred to Berklee College of Music to study voice and began writing and recording her own material. On her 1996 debut The Burdens of Being Upright, Bonham established herself as a brash rocker with ironic nods to the emerging music of punk grrrrl bands. With blunt, direct observations on love and loss, the album went gold and earned the singer Grammy nominations for Best Alternative Music Performance and Best Female Vocalist.</p><p>Critics took notice as well. Rolling Stone noted ""this classically trained Boston singer-songwriter sets meandering Aimee Mann-like melodies over bright electro-pop folk with string-laden atmospherics."" ""Mother Mother"", her first single, became a nationwide anthem and earned the singer an MTV Video Music Awards nomination. From the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, Bonham steadily recorded and performed both individually and with numerous groups, appearing with everyone from Blue Man Group and Aerosmith and to Ron Sexsmith and Juliana Hatfield. Following 2005's Blink the Brightest and the 2006 EP In the City + In the Woods, the singer took some time to focus on other things, earning a yoga teaching certification while learning to live a more balanced life, not realizing initially that her non-musical experiences would be fodder for what would eventually become Masts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,2198,Schiavone,,http://www.facebook.com/SchiavoneMusic,http://www.schiavonemcgee.com/category/videos/,http://www.schiavonemcgee.com/,8232,"<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

Growing up in a large military family in rural King George, Virginia, I realized at a young age that music was the one thing that gave me true peace and happiness while sharing space with seven brothers and two sisters. I can remember having one of the first generation &ldquo;walk-man&rdquo; radios and singing quietly to the latest hits on the radio. I couldn&rsquo;t seem to catch a baseball to save my life and getting crushed every time the football was passed my way wasn&rsquo;t my idea of fun so I found my friends on the radio. KISS,Parliament Funkadelic, The Jacksons, Zeppelin, Aretha, Elton, Prince, The Stones and later U2 and The Clash. Whatever came across the airwaves at the time, I was off somewhere by myself singing it. It became an early passion, this singing thing. I eventually gathered the courage to sign up for a talent show at my school.I would race home every day and secretly rehearse for the show. I can remember not telling anyone I had signed up for the show until I walked onto the stage. The place went crazy when I took the stage. I walked away the winner that day and the seed was planted.</p><p>Music was my motivation from that point forward. That motivation got me a music scholarship at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia and I was soon approached to be the lead singer of an upstart band called Boy O Boy (BOB). We quickly gained a following, and toured the East Coast playing many clubs, colleges and well anywhere that would feed us, pay us a little cash and give us a place to catch a nap before we were off to the next town.</p><p>We changed our name to Fighting Gravity some years later, and found ourselves signed to several major labels and sharing major stages with many awesome bands, too many to name actually. We toured much of the continental US and around the globe on several USO tours that took us to places such as Japan, Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Singapore. It was an amazing and exciting ride, and what I most appreciated was the many positive friends that those travels brought into my life. Many of whom are still a part of my life today. As Fighting Gravity came to an end, I stepped away from the music industry for a few years in order to find a different inspiration.</p><p>However, I found myself drawn repeatedly back to the fire. The desire to get back on stage again was overwhelming. This desire led me to begin work on a life-long dream and this time I was going to do it my way and tell my story. With the help of co-writer and producer Chip Johnson of the rock band The Alternate Routes, this dream has finally come true with the Fall 2010 release of my solo CD titled My Only Secret. This music is personal. Layers were stripped away and barriers were removed and I wanted to tell a simple story of my life, my love and share it with my family and friends. It is a reflection of where I am today. It is about realizing the better side of life and those you choose to share it with. It is my hope that you will be able to draw the same inspiration from listening to the music as I have had in sharing with you.</p>",,,,,2197,We Were Kings CD Release and Dance Party,,http://www.facebook.com/wewerekings,http://www.youtube.com/user/wewerekings2010,http://www.wewerekings.net,11182,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We Were Kings was formed in 2010. Three years in the making frontman Nate Ihara has pieced together his solo turned group effort with songs, band members, and producers one by one. Ihara formerly fronted the now defunct D.C. based band Welbilt before picking up the bass guitar for The Blackjacks, another popular band from the area currently by way of Nashville, TN. With himself fronting the project, the unofficial lineup additionally consists of Mike Smirnoff (No Second Troy and The Blackjacks) on drums, Cal Stamp on guitars and keys, and a small cast of a revolving members from various local and national bands.</p><p>The songs are inspired by a variety of influences ranging from Sting and The Police to Elvis Costello, Brighteyes to The Black Keys, Ryan Adams, and One Republic. While the band itself is young it's members are all veterans of the music scene on both the local and national level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of Breaking Borders began inside the minds of lead singer Will Ruben and guitarist/pianist Nathan Kastner as they entered Thomas Wootton high school. This idea began to materialize with the two friends writing awful, acoustic, 3 doors down-esque songs that they recorded on garage band (For the record, those songs have since been deleted). But, it didn't matter how bad the songs were, they loved writing music and couldn't get enough. The two friends agreed that simply writing acoustic music wasn't cutting it anymore and decided to begin a band.  So with the help of Falon Lewis (drums), Matt Oberdorfer (guitar), and Justin Pugrant (bass), Breaking Borders was formed.</p><p>Since it's humble beginnings, Breaking Borders has garnered a reputation as one of DC-metro-areas hardest working, and best sounding bands.  Their live show has been called electric and has been known to leave fans craving more.  In 2009 they released a self-titled EP, which received much praise from critics and fans alike.  The band has gigged extensively over the years following the release, and has played at such venues as the 9:30 Club, Jammin' Java, the Rockville Rooftop, the Bethesda Theatre and many more.  They have even received radio airtime on such premier local stations as Hot 99.5 and DC 101.  Since mid-2010, they have also been hard at work in the studio writing and recording their first full-length record, This Crazy Weather.  After much anticipation the record is set to be released on September 9th, 2011 at a CD release show at Jammin' Java.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Breaking Borders</span> <a href=""http://www.purevolume.com/BreakingBorders"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/breakingborders"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/breakingborders"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/breakingbordersmusic"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/BreakingBordersMusic"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Big Hurry is a four piece indie rock band from Pittsburgh that has  been described by The Fader as ""adventurous in style... filling their  pop inclinations with ragged riffs, an implied affinity for lushness,  and some seriously fierce drum fills that sound like they're coming for  your family.""

Aliens! Vampires! Dinosaurs! back in 2006. Over the past four years the band have parted with their old record label, retooled their lineup, released a handful of EPs and performed everywhere from the Philippines to living rooms. All of these cumulative experiences play into the band's new album Would It Kill You? a collection of perfect pop gems that not only proves that Hellogoodbye are still relevant but affirms that if anything, they've sharpened their musical edge over the past few years-and looking back, the band's frontman Forrest Kline sees the past few years as an amazing opportunity to hone his craft without pressure.</p><p>""I'm super slow at everything no matter what I do,"" Kline explains when asked what the process of writing and recording Would It Kill You? was like. ""If I'm going to clean out my closet it'll take me all day because I'll empty out the whole thing, then I'll paint it, then I'll tear off the drawers and get new hardware. Everything becomes a process and musically it's the same thing,"" he continues with a laugh. ""If I do one thing, I have to do 900 tasks to get it done, so to be able to take the time with this album was a relief because I didn't have to stress about not having enough time to accomplish everything I wanted to do with these songs.""</p><p>Released on the band's own label Wasted Summer and recorded with longtime producer Matt Mahaffey (Beck, Tenacious D) at his studio as well as Kline's renovated garage, Kline approached Would It Kill You? in very much the same way he did the band's debut: by concentrating on the songwriting instead of fancy production tricks. ""We did our first record in my living room with a laptop and for this new record I tore down my garage to build a studio so I could record there,"" Kline explains. ""It was a great situation because I could stay up all night and mess around with stuff and not have any pressure to watch the clock or please anyone except myself.""</p><p>While Kline remains to be the main songwriter in Hellogoodbye, the new lineup on Would It Kill You? also reinvigorated him and helped the group fully realize this batch of songs. Featuring bassist Travis Head, keyboard/guitarist Joseph Marro (formerly of the Early November), multi-instrumentalist Andrew Richards and drummer Michael Nielsen, the band's current lineup was handpicked by Kline over the past few years and he couldn't be more pleased with the results. ""It's been great because the first lineup happened in high school and for whatever reason a lot of them weren't interested in touring full-time,"" Kline explains. ""This has been an awesome opportunity to play with a bunch of people I've always wanted to share the stage with and everyone is on the same page.""</p><p>From the upbeat opener ""Finding Something To Do"" to horn-driven, Shins-esque indie rock romps like ""Betrayed By Bones"" and epic, intricately arranged masterpieces such as ""The Thoughts That Give Me The Creeps,"" Would It Kill You? sees the band exploring new instrumental timbres that bring out the inherent sonic subtleties in these tracks. ""On the last record there were some songs that had sequenced horns, but on this record everything is real,"" Kline explains. ""Instead of trying to recreate a sound we would just have someone come in and play that instrument and I think you can really tell the difference when you're listening to this album.""</p><p>Musically the disc retains Kline's love of doo-wop and Oldies, but puts them into a fresh, new context to keep these influences from sounding clich&eacute;d. ""When I was in third grade all I listened to was oldies radio so that's been a huge influence on me for my entire life,"" Kline explains when asked how he manages to keep the music on Would It Kill You? sounding so fresh. ""That said, I've never liked it when something sounds like a throwback or sounds old for the sake of being old because that's already been done before,"" Kline explains. ""I like it better if someone takes what they like about something and does it in a more natural way.""</p><p>When it comes to the lyrics, Would It Kill You? is deceptively complex and is more of a mental journey than a traditional narrative. ""I went through a lot in the course of making this record because it took a very long time,"" Kline explains. ""Just before I started it I got engaged and by the end I was married, so there are a lot of songs dealing with the process of being unsure about a relationship to knowing you made the right decision,"" he continues. ""Even in a really good relationship there are still times when you're fighting so there are a few songs that touch on that, but most of it is celebrating it,"" he adds, noting that true to his personality there is also a healthy dose of paranoia present in many of these songs.</p><p>Ultimately after three years of hard work, sweat and anticipation, Kline and his bandmates are simply happy to finally have the album finished and can't wait for their fans to hear it. ""There was a point when I was nervous that this album might never come out and I thought that maybe I should give up, but once I had written these songs I knew I had to release them somehow,"" he explains when asked what kept him motivated to make these ideas a reality. ""I just knew I had to finish it once I started it because everyone in this band is just as excited as I am about these songs,"" he summarizes. ""That energy is contagious."" ..</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,2194,Holly Montgomery,,,,,0,,,,,,2193,In Layman Terms,,,,http://www.reverbnation.com/#!/inlaymanterms,8421,"<p>In Layman Terms is a family band.

Ryan and Sara had just begun writing and recording songs together on an old 4-track with a mic hanging from the blade of a ceiling fan in the middle of that stifling sweaty summer, but they would soon part ways and leave New Orleans. Over the next couple of years they relocated to Providence together and later settled in Brooklyn where Don had also settled after Katrina.</p><p>Life of Love is the first collection of songs Callers wrote and recorded exclusively in New York as a three-piece. Naturally the band's sound grew in volume in response to the volume of the city; however, they held on to what makes them so consistently affecting: their raw spartan style, anchored by Sara's sensually tough vocals, and Ryan and Don's Southern-honed chops as multi-instrumentalists.</p><p>The album started with the band's cover of Wire's ""Heartbeat"", and the idea of creating something simple and cathartic. Using borrowed amps and mics, in bedrooms and in studios, and by the grace of their good friends, Callers recorded Life of Love in intense spurts over the course of a year. Unlike the experimental ballads on their debut Fortune, the new songs pulse with gritty urgency, colored by the sounds of damaged gear and the earnest spirit of a middle-school gospel choir. The result is an album stripped to the core, an expression of the inexpressible space between us and the places we inhabit and the people we share those places with.</p>",,,,,2173,Grace Pettis,,,,,0,,,,,,2165,An Evening With Willy Porter,,,,,14437,"<p><span style=""color: #ffffff;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p><span style=""color: #ffffff;""></span>Willy Porter <a href=""http://www.willyporter.com"" style=""color: #999999;"" target=""_blank"">official site</a><span style=""color: #999999;""> | </span><a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/WillyPorter"" style=""color: #999999;"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a><span style=""color: #999999;""> | </span><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/willyportermusic"" style=""color: #999999;"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a><span style=""color: #999999;""> | </span><a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Falbum%252Favailable-light%252Fid199902196%253Fi%253D199902204%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" style=""color: #999999;"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a><span style=""color: #999999;""> | </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRgU5kNDanw&amp;feature=related"" style=""color: #999999;"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>""How To Rob A Bank,"" the latest release from esteemed guitarist/singer-songwriter Willy Porter, showcases his continued growth as a songwriter and recording artist. Porter offers a rich blend of salt and sugar with tracks that move easily from rough-hewn electric edges into soulful irony with equal aplomb. Jeff Giles of Popdose.com says, ""It's another solid entry in a discography full of them, and one of the smarter, more durable albums of grown-up music we're likely to get this year.""</p><p>Having toured with artists as diverse as Jeff Beck and Tori Amos, Porter capitalizes on his experience as a seasoned live performer on How To Rob A Bank. World-renowned guitarist Greg Koch had this to say about Porter's new disc: ""you get the same feeling listening to it as you do from one of his solo gig's...that you are in the presence of greatness..."" Each song is a fresh cross-pollination of styles, genres and musical forms. Frets Magazine called Porter ""a genre-defying maverick."" He continues on that path as he easily transitions from the light-hearted McCartney-esque ""Lemon Tree"" into ""I Didn't Bring it Up,"" in which Porter wryly declares he ""checked the oil and cleared the gutters"" of mid-life marriage. In the electric guitar driven ""Hard Place"" he digs into three generations of an American soldier's perspective. The rest of the album includes flavors of New Orleans (""Wide Open Mind""), The Band (""Psychic Vampire"") and post-bluegrass country (""Barefoot Reel"").</p><p>Willy Porter ""...has crafted some of his most irresistibly tuneful songs yet.""

Rather then shy away from the competition, however, ETA relished the challenge, the local music scene emboldening them to create bigger and better tracks. Sweet pop influences filter through their distinctive rock undertones, pulling you in and gripping you tightly until the very last notes have finished ringing in your eardrums. The vocals provide stark contrast to Rayshawn's pulse-pounding rhymes, resulting in a thrill-ride from beginning to end that you just can't seem to get out of your head.</p><p>ETA's efforts came to fruition. They worked hard and played even harder. The recent addition of a new vocalist, Chris, brings lyrical and musical experience into an already diverse and accomplished group. The result? You don't have to strain very hard to hear it. ETA travels around the Northern VA/MD area, playing shows in a wide variety of venues. And they leave their mark wherever they go; whipping each crowd into a frenzy and threatening to blow the roofs skyward.</p>",,,,,2152,The Toasters (30th Anniversary Tour) with special guests,http://www.myspace.com/toasters,,,http://www.toasters.org/,7622,"<p>Thirty years ago a bunch of upstarts ignited a spark on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. A spark that fired the imagination of the American music scene, causing a global conflagration. That music was Ska and the band was THE TOASTERS. The 2-Tone sound re-created in their own image by this unruly group of ruffians synthesized the classic 70's British sound with east side Punk and rock and is now regarded as being the precursor to the Third Wave of Ska. The embers of the legacy bequeathed by The Specials, The Selecter, The Beat and Madness were rekindled and the Toasters hit the road. Hard.</p><p>Five-thousand some gigs later the sparks are still flying and the band is ready to pick up the cudgels once again for their 2011 30th Anniversary tour. Some of the faces may be different but, of course, the song remains the same. The distinctive Toasters sound has recently been hallmarked as one of CBGB's 20 core bands (Clear Channel Radio) and nothing could make the band prouder than being ranked up there with personal heroes The Ramones.</p><p>To mark the occasion of the grand 30th, there will be a special brew Toasters 30th IPA flowing from the vats of SKA BREWING COMPANY in Boulder, Colorado. Following this up with a shot of Jaegermeister they will be ready to roll the Bandwagon across the USA from coast to coast</p><p>There has been much acclaim from Billboard, the New York Times, Alternative Press, MTV and many others but the band is more interested in playing for the fans. To that end the group has undertaken missions across the globe, playing from Siberia to Istanbul and back, laying down the tracks for others to follow. According to lead singer Bucket, nothing can eclipse the vibes of a sweaty packed-out club with the audience in your face and the bit between the teeth.</p><p>It's important not to forget where you came from. Lots of bands do that but not the Toasters!</p>",,,,,2150,The Resistance EP Release,http://www.myspace.com/theresistanceva,http://www.facebook.com/theresistanceband,,http://www.theresistanceband.com/,12280,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Late show!</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""><br /></span></p><p>The Resistance emerged in early 2009 with musical influences ranging from Death Cab for Cutie, Coldplay, U2 and Radiohead. This indie-rock powerhouse is comprised of four seasoned musicians from the local scene bringing together a different, yet powerful mix of musical styles and genres. The Resistance has built a loyal following that has describes them as an indie band that incorporates a wide-range of styles into their music... simple, yet refined guitars with melodic undertones and a warm texture, high energy driving beats to ballad songs with a sprinkle of indie rock riffs, compassionate vocals with a soft voice but an occasional loud declaration of presence and a solid low end bass guitar that gives a rich depth to the overall sound.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,http://twitter.com/theresistanceva,,2147,DJ Nick@Nite,,,,,0,,,,,,2145,The Sugar Free

nothing but keyboards, drums, and the occasional handclap, Sugar Free Allstars bring some serious funk and get the kids in the house dancing. &nbsp;Take your kids to this show when you need them to sleep well that night.""</strong></p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Imagine that Deep Purple and Sly and the Family Stone had a love child that grew up in New Orleans listening to Ray Charles, Black Sabbath and Booker T. That love child would be the Sugar Free Allstars. With their diverse musical influences and unusual instrumentation, this funky organ/drum duo from Oklahoma City doesn&rsquo;t quite fit into any given pigeonhole. The music blends New Orleans funk, Memphis soul and Hammond organ-drenched gospel, wrapped in a colorful rock and roll package.<span>&nbsp; </span>Add to the mix a touch of pop songwriting sensibilities, humor and a high-energy live show and you&rsquo;ve got the Sugar Free Allstars.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Chris &ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; Wiser (Hammond B-3 organ, lead vocals, saxophone) and Rob &ldquo;Dr. Rock&rdquo; Martin (drums, back-up vocals) make up the dynamic duo of Sugar Free Allstars. As Wiser multi tasks the outfit covering bass lines on the B-3 and cranking out soulful sax solos, Martin lays down a rock-solid beat that keeps the heads bopping and hips shaking.<span>&nbsp; </span>His in-the-pocket style of playing has made him a high demand drummer and aside from his work in Sugar Free Allstars, he is the first call studio drummer for the legendary Bell Labs in Norman, OK (where all SFA&rsquo;s albums are recorded). The connection and fire between the two musicians is obvious in their live performance. &ldquo;We try to provide a good mix of humor and a tight performance,&rdquo; explains Wiser. &ldquo;Even in our kids&rsquo; shows, it&rsquo;s meant to be a rock and roll party for all ages.&rdquo;</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">The Sugar Free Allstars are always on the road. Calling Oklahoma City home, they perform at venues around the Midwest, South and Rocky Mountain States.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 2008 SFA toured Europe for the first time, spending 11 days in Italy playing to very receptive crowds. Beginning in 2007 SFA performed their first family concerts and since then have played at the Jiggle Jam Family Fest in Kansas City, on the Little Rocker&rsquo;s Stage at the Norman Music Festival in Oklahoma, at the Kindiefest Family Music Conference in Brooklyn, NY and on the Austin Kiddie Limits kid&rsquo;s stage at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in Austin, TX. The educational aspect of their music shines through at elementary school performances and Summer Reading Programs at libraries in Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri and Texas. SFA is listed on the Oklahoma Arts Council's Touring Roster and the Mid-America Arts Alliance's Artist Registry.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">In spring 2010, the band released its second family music CD, Funky Fresh and Sugar Free,<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to rave reviews.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some of the highlights since its release have been: a review on People Magazine&rsquo;s website, a mention in Parents Magazine, a starred review in School Library Journal, a National Parenting Publication Awards (NAPPA) Gold Award and a second #1 hit on the Sirius-XM Satellite Radio Kid&rsquo;s channel (the James Brown-influenced &ldquo;Tiger In My Backyard&rdquo;).<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition, following this release SFA was one of twelve family music acts included in a photo essay on Time Magazine&rsquo;s website featuring some of the &ldquo;Kindie Rock&rdquo; (indie rock for kids) genre&rsquo;s top stars.</p><p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">SFA&rsquo;s first kid&rsquo;s album, Dos Ninos (2007) also received national critical acclaim and was among the Fids and Kamily critics&rsquo; poll as one of the top 15 &ldquo;Best Music of 2007 for Kids and Families.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>The first song on the disc, &ldquo;Bathtub Boy&rdquo;, was in the Sirius-XM Satellite Radio Kids channel&rsquo;s top 13 charts for thirteen weeks, peaking at #1 for two of them. The song is still in regular rotation on Sirius-XM&rsquo;s Kids Place Live.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 2008, SFA released the live concert DVD, Gettin' Funky with the Sugar Free Allstars!, recorded with a family audience at the City Arts Center in Oklahoma City. The band&rsquo;s three other studio albums are meant for grown-ups: the self-titled Sugar Free Allstars, Dos Machos and Return of Dos Machos. Songs from these last two albums have appeared in episodes of PBS&rsquo; &ldquo;Roadtrip Nation,&rdquo; and both releases have spent time on the Jambands.com&rsquo;s top 30 radio charts.<span>&nbsp; </span>Return of Dos Machos also features a guest appearance by Fred Tackett, guitarist for Little Feat.</p>",,,,,2142,DJ M.A.F.,,,,,0,,,,,,2137,"Brian Huber Full Band ""Imagination of Ourselves"" CD Release",http://www.myspace.com/brianhubermusic,,,http://www.brianhubermusic.com,7623,"<p>There's something very liberating about recording a song in your boxers. That's one perk I enjoyed recording my new album, ""Imagination of Ourselves."" My latest effort is a collection of songs blending humor, introspection, melancholy, and optimism, set to an organic Britpop feel, without the pretense. These songs invite you to listen.</p><p>Liberation is one of the central themes that run through the album, whether it's the tongue-in-cheek humor of ""Snuggies"" and ""Shipwrecked (Part 1 and 2)"" or the meditative ""Talk Without a Word"" and ""Reverie.""</p><p>This album evolved from my desire to accomplish something I've been putting off for way too long. I guess you could say that life got in the way and imagining myself accomplish this goal compelled me to do it. I had to record this album.</p><p>I made a couple of decisions early on that would steer its creation: I wanted to produce it in my apartment and not in a studio while the clock was ominously ticking; and I wanted to be as self-reliant as possible in recording it so that it's an accurate reflection of who I am as a person.</p><p>The songs run the gamut of emotions: the sadness of someone leaving, the humdrum routine of an office job, losing a big hand in poker, the beauty of the world around us, and the most important thing in life, other people, since happiness is only real when shared.</p><p>Without being melodramatic, this album is the culmination all of the joy, frustration, accomplishments, setbacks, victories, and defeats I've experienced in the 13 years I've been making music. It's a long-overdue project and I can't wait to make it real by sharing it with you.</p><p>Some notable quotes about my music:</p><p>""...some of the best pop-rock the '60s never heard."" <em>-The Washington Post</em></p><p>""Lucky Day creates some of the most ear-pleasing Brit-poppish sounds we've heard in a while."" <em>-The Washington City Paper</em></p><p>""'Time Will Only Know' is a bouncy, melodic slice of tasty pop with jangly guitars and sultry vocals..."" <em>-MetroMusicScene.com</em></p><p>""Any of the tracks, especially, 'Overcast,' could feel right at home on the Garden State soundtrack..."" <em>-The Broadside, George Mason University</em></p>",,,,,2130,Our Daily Bread Presents Dave LaMotte,,,,http://www.davidlamotte.com/,7422,"<p>A veteran of 10 CDs and 2000 concerts in 47 states and on four continents, David LaMotte is an award-winning song writer, a children's book author, the founder of a successful non-profit and a popular public speaker. In all of his work, though, there is a common thread - he is about connecting people, both to themselves and to each other. LaMotte is warm without being overly sentimental, political without being strident, and he speaks without forgetting to listen.</p><p>As the co-founder and volunteer director of a non-profit organization, PEG Partners, he works with schools in Guatemala to improve learning environments there. Because of his strong commitment to peacemaking, he has traveled in several of the world's conflict zones, from Bosnia to Belfast and from Hebron to Haiti, promoting intercultural understanding and seeking to learn from peo- ple on the front lines of peace work.</p><p>A strong advocate for arts education, David presents classes and keynotes at schools, churches and conferences as well as teaching at writing workshops such as Augusta State University's Sand Hills Writers Conference and Warren-Wilson College's Swannanoa Gathering. His children's book, S.S. Bathtub, is based on his award-winning children's song by the same name.</p><p>LaMotte's music has been honored with numerous awards and grants as well as artist sponsorships from Taylor Guitars and John Pearse Strings. His song Dark and Deep was included on Songs Inspired By Literature, Chapter One, a benefit CD to raise money for adult literacy. Other artists on that CD include Bruce Springsteen, Aimee Mann and Suzanne Vega.</p><p>In 2008 LaMotte suspended his music career to give his focus to his other vocational passion, peacemaking. As a recipient of the prestigious Rotary World Peace Fellowship, he obtained a masters degree in International Relations, Peace and Conflict Resolution at Brisbane, Australia's University of Queensland. As part of that fellowship, he also spent three months in rural India working with a Gandhian development organization.</p><p>Now he has returned to limited touring, due to being the father of a toddler. While keeping a lighter tour schedule, he is also working with the North Carolina Council of Churches as their Program Associate for Peace and writing a book, tentatively titled Worldchanging 101: WhyYourHopeIsNotNaive.</p>",,,,,2116,Elizabeth and The Catapult,http://www.myspace.com/elizabethandthecatapult,http://www.facebook.com/elizabethandthecatapult,http://www.youtube.com/elizabethcatapltvevo,http://www.elizabethandthecatapult.com/,9062,"<p>""I'd hope there's humor to both of our albums, but they're actually quite different from one another,"" says Elizabeth Ziman, the singer/songwriter/keyboardist behind Elizabeth &amp; the Catapult. ""While Taller Children has the sarcastic lightness of a Woody Allen film, the new record's more in the vein of Kubrick or Lynch. It's a bit darker, a bit more tongue-in-cheek - another side to who we are.""</p><p>The reason for this shift isn't as simple as a sudden breakup or breakdown. The dissonant strains are lurking between the lines, from the clanging chords and galloping groove of ""The Horse and the Missing Cart"" to the hopeful but bitter contrasts of ""Thank You For Nothing,"" a heartbroken ballad that channels the Buddhist teachings of an old Leonard Cohen poem.</p><p>As it turns out, Elizabeth read Cohen's Book of Longing collection from cover to cover while working on the Lincoln Center song cycle - performed last spring for a commission from NPR's John Schaefer - that gave The Other Side of Zero its title and a handful of tracks. As the pages sunk in, one particular theme stood out: Cohen's struggle to meet Buddhist goals in a monastery, which Elizabeth felt paralleled her own coming-of-age struggles while living and growing up in New York City.</p><p>""Once I finished the book,"" she says, ""I realized that reaching this zen state wasn't a realistic goal. Not for Leonard, and certainly not for me. It's more about the intent of letting go, and being able to laugh after you fall.""</p><p>Cohen's book also helped Elizabeth see parallels between the pain and growth in relationships and the gestures of balance in Buddhism. Songs about taming the extremes, finding similarities between opposites, and accepting the moment. While ""Thank You For Nothing"" sounds pretty self-explanatory, it does more than pull the plug on a flatlining relationship. It exposes the blurry line between gratitude and ingratitude, and how they often feed off of each other. (""I'll just keep saying it/Thank you, thank you/Thank you for everything/Thank you for nothing at all."") Meanwhile, ""The Horse and the Missing Cart"" is a cautionary tale about seizing the day; about actually doing things, rather than worrying about whether or not you should act.</p><p>Which brings us to why The Other Side of Zero is Elizabeth &amp; the Catapult's rawest set of recordings yet. Unlike their thoroughly-demoed debut - an album that took two years to complete - the Zero sessions boiled down to a month of recording with producer Tony Berg (Peter Gabriel, Phantom Planet, Jesca Hoop) and such respected sidemen as guitarist Blake Mills and Tom Waits' longtime touring keyboardist, Patrick Warren.</p><p>The result was rough but refined, bruised but beautiful, as if Berg had placed a mic in a room and walked away, letting Elizabeth and drummer Danny Molad do their thing. Or as Elizabeth puts it, ""This record's more abrasive, more blatantly honest - perhaps even rude at times. Maybe intentionally so.""</p><p>Rude isn't the right word. More like scrappy and spontaneous, with Elizabeth's film score skills - for a while there, she wanted to be a scene-stealing composer - coloring each song like a Technicolor movie print. Take ""Go Away My Lover,"" a dagger-drawing duet that brings a couple to its close alongside speaker-smacking drums, demented whistles, and a call-and-response chorus that races to put all of this - the memories, the longing, and ultimately, the regret - to rest.</p><p>And then there's the title track. Led by a lean, winding piano line, it builds to a spine-tingling crescendo alongside the honey-dipped harmonies of Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings - a collaboration that was completely unplanned. Not that you'd notice, considering how seamless it sounds.</p><p>One thing Elizabeth made sure to write down months in advance were her lyrics, which often take months of intensive editing. And even then, it's hard to let them go without poring over every last word. Especially in this case - a highly personal examination of love and loss, and growing older.</p><p>""Even the happiest sounding pop songs on this record have a tinge of regret and darkness to them,"" explains Elizabeth. ""And thank goodness for that. Ultimately that's the only way I'd feel comfortable singing them. I'm drawn to the ambiguity like a menacing smile.""</p>",,,,,2105,Ameerkat vs Matheus,,,,,0,,,,,,2104,BASSFACE Presents It's First Dubstep & DnB Banger w/ Grime Syndicate,,http://www.facebook.com/grimesyndicate,http://www.youtube.com/grimesyndicate,http://grime-syndicate.com/,7333,"<p>We are a four man all Dubstep tag crew based out of Washington, DC.

His music is hip-hop with new formulas and a new attitude. JUSTi had his foot in the industry as an independent promoter for a few years before he decided to roll the dice himself. When he began to make his own music, the instincts were there. JUSTi clearly learned a few things from being around the go-go scene. His music would not necessarily be considered go-go, but the energy is comparable. JUSTi's first released is titled ""F#@! Your Couch."" The concept is humorous, and loosely tied around the Dave Chappelle skit. But more so, just a saying that can apply to quite a few things. It's an ironic philosophy that makes more sense than you might believe.

From his days fronting seminal hardcore trio Heart Attack and infamous glam punks D Generation, then seven years on the road as a solo artist, Malin had cultivated a devout fan base. He'd shared stages with everyone from The White Stripes to Counting Crows, The Hold Steady to Lucinda Williams, but felt like he was losing the plot.</p><p>Malin contemplated going back to school, becoming a standup comedian or a Las Vegas wedding DJ, and even started work on a documentary film about DC hardcore Rastafarians The Bad Brains. For over a year he didn't play or record. When asked by a Hollywood screenwriter to pen songs for a film about author J.D. Salinger, Malin - a fan of Catcher in the Rye and other Salinger works - traveled to Cornish, NH hoping to speak to the famous recluse. In typical punk-rock fashion, instead of getting the interview, Malin landed at the local precinct for trespassing and was released only after the cops watched his video duet with Bruce Springsteen for ""Broken Radio"" on YouTube and were convinced he was just a writer doing research. Though he never met Salinger (who passed away this past January), Malin made the most of the experience by writing ""The Archer"" and ""Lonely at Heart""-two songs that would make him want to work again and become the basis for his new album.</p><p>When Jesse met producer Ted Hutt (Lucero, Flogging Molly, The Gaslight Anthem) one drunken night at a local bar, their talk of making a record fast, loose, and raw, was the beginning of Hutt's quest to create a record that would encompass Malin's roots and evolution-from hardcore thrasher to punk/folk singer-songwriter. The album's basic tracks were laid in three days at Greenpoint, Brooklyn's Mission Studios, and the rest at Sonic Youth's Think Tank Studios in Hoboken, NJ. Filled with the characters Malin does best-messengers and misanthropes, hipsters and hypocrites-and as always, his constant themes of redemption, nightlife, heartbreak, and survival, LOVE IT TO LIFE-a sentiment taken from a ticket stub Joe Strummer autographed for Jesse-was built with desperate optimism that shouts in gang vocals that no matter how bad it gets, you're never alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/jesse-malin/id2663710?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/jesse_malin,,2068,Cletus & Lori,http://www.myspace.com/kennellyandkelley,,,http://mysite.verizon.net/vzer2rg0/id8.html,0,"<p>Award-winning singer-songwriters on their own, Cletus Kennelly &amp; Lori Kelley combined their artistries, developing a style and a sense for each other's voices that is magical.  ""I haven't heard harmonies this tight since Simon &amp; Garfunkel"" (Gene Dawson, Dawson Concerts)  Their work has earned them 40 WAMMIE nominations and eleven WAMMIE awards (Washington Area Music Awards) between them, including the WAMMIE award for BEST CONTEMPORARY FOLK GROUP (three times).  Both approach their writing from a lyrical, melodic place with songs that speak to the heart.  The wit and depth each adds to the other's songs makes for an engaging show.  ""Cletus and Lori are two standout solo performers whose voices blend beautifully.""  (Scott Moore, Moore House Concerts)  As solo artists, and again as a duo, both Cletus &amp; Lori were selected to perform at D.C.'s Kennedy Center. <br /> <br />Cletus &amp; Lori are Twenty-first Century Troubadours. Their stellar vocals, captivating harmonies, and beautiful guitar work will land their story-songs at the doorstep to your heart and leave you longing for more.""  (Rick LaRocca, Columbia Lakefront Festival)<br /> <br />Cletus describes Lori as ""a gift that just landed in my lap. I was a solo performer when we met, and wasn't really looking for a duo partner, but Lori really thought we should sing together, and she was right.  I'm eternally grateful for her tenacity.  Singing with her has been a gift to me.""<br /> <br />""What's better than a good singer-songwriter?  Two singer-songwriters whose meshed voices seem built for close harmony.  That's the case for Lori Kelley and Cletus Kennelly, two independent artists who began collaborating five years ago after meeting at a Mid-Atlantic Song Contest awards ceremony and exchanging CDs.  Kelley showed up at Kennelly's next gig having learned all the songs on his debut album, Thread, and they immediately started weaving a new vocal tapestry.  Kelley, blessed with a four-octave range, leans toward pop, while Kennelly is a 12-string guitarist in a more contemporary folk/pop mode, but they fit well together and obviously savor harmony singing.  Kelley and Kennelly have each won multiple Wammies, including this year as Best Contemporary Folk Group, and they'll soon make their longtime partnership official with their first recording as a duo.""   (Richard Harrington, The Washington Post, 3-18-05)<br /> <br />""In addition to sharing close harmonies on their new CD, Lotus, Cletus Kennelly and Lori Kelley alternately contribute tunes that tend to fall gracefully between folk and pop.  In fact, so consistent is the song quality that it's sometimes hard to tell who wrote what.  Among Kennelly's best efforts are The Gate, an inspirational love song concerning a soldier blinded on the battlefield, and Looking Up, a 9/11 ballad that's likely to outlast most.  As for Kelley's lyrics, none is more poetic or evocative than Snow Is Falling, a contemporary spiritual dedicated to Pfc. Lori Piestewa, one of a handful of Native American women in the U.S. military and the first woman to die in the Iraq war.""

American born, Buffalo, New York, 1961. Left home, moved to New York City in 1978, and began playing in the experimental musical group Gray with artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. After leaving Gray he formed the band Bohack and recorded the highly regarded avant-garde industrial noise album It Took Several Wives.</p><p>During the same period Gallo also became known in New York City for his very unusual street performances, which were spontaneously executed in public and also witnessed by invited guests in the know. The One Armed Man, The Man with No Face, Sandman, Boy Hit by a Car, and Boy Cries in Restaurant Window to name a few. These radical public performances were upsetting and disturbing and were meant to provoke thought, self-reflection and consciousness. Gallo's invited guests could witness his performance's impact in this larger public context.</p><p>One invited guest, New York Underground filmmaker Eric Mitchell, cast Gallo as the lead in his film The Way It Is alongside newcomer Steve Buscemi. The Way It Is was Gallo's first appearance in a feature length film, though previously he had directed himself in several short films including If You Feel Froggy Jump, The Gun Lover, and Rocky 10 as well as the collaborations with filmmaker Michael Holman Vincent Gallo as Jesus Christ (used in Julian Schnabel's Basquiat) and Vampire LeStat.</p><p>Since his early performance art days Gallo has continued to create very conceptual performance pieces. Examples are a series of protesting of protests. Gallo has also created his own website which upon closer examination is actually a highly conceptual artwork resonating with his early performance work.</p><p>On his website www.vincentgallo.com in the merchandise section Gallo is selling his sperm and sexual fantasies as conceptual works. Gallo's Internet art questions celebrity, procreation, ego, social agenda, and views of religion, race and sexuality. These public offerings are motivated by extreme sensitivity, concept and thoughtfulness, however their presentation appears crude and offensive. Misinterpretation of this work is common and Gallo is often incorrectly categorized as a racist, sexist, homophobe.</p><p>Gallo has had over 25 one-man shows of his paintings, including several with famed New York art dealer Annina Nosei and 4 museum shows including one at the Hara Museum in Tokyo, Japan.</p><p>Gallo has also released several musical albums including 2 on the prestigious Warp Records label-When and Recordings of Music for Film. Gallo wrote, composed and performed the original music for the films Buffalo 66, The Agent, and Promises Written in Water.</p><p>In the 1980s Gallo reached the professional level of Grand Prix motorcycle racing, though he did not win a national championship. Gallo is one of the actual motorcycle riders in his feature film The Brown Bunny.</p><p>For many years Gallo has been known and highly respected in hi-fi and music recording circles and is considered by many professionals in the field as having world-class knowledge and experience. He has been published many times by specialty magazines focused on high fidelity designs and equipment as well as music recording techniques and equipment. His collection of vintage hi-fi and recording gear as well as musical instruments is amongst the largest and most refined in the world. Gallo is also a fanatic record collector, owning over 35,000 vinyl LP's.</p><p>Gallo has no agent, manager, assistant or intern and he makes his films without producers, and with extremely scaled down crews. He has self distributed his movies and is directly involved in his films' sales for distribution. Gallo has also created all of his films' trailers and posters.</p><p>Gallo is one of the most misunderstood, misquoted, misrepresented talents in the past 25 years and a brief review of his IMDB page suggests he has also been incredibly prolific.</p>",,,,,2038,States (featuring Mindy White of Lydia & members of Copeland),http://www.myspace.com/states,http://www.facebook.com/statesmusic,,,7038,"<p>Dear Friends,</p><p>There are those rare moments in life where things work out just the way you want them to.

(14 hours north of Vancouver). Musically, he lives everywhere in between. His trademark sugarcane-sweet melodies, pop-soul hooks and rock chords subtly subvert commonly held notions of what Cuban music is. Alex is on the vanguard, crafting a cross-cultural sound that mirrors his geographical journey. Not tied to tradition, this Cuban-Canadian prefers his vintage Gibson over el sencerro (cowbell) anytime.</p><p>Forgoing conventional stereotypes that typify much of the Latin music landscape, Alex is instead defining his own ""Latin Soul"" genre. Like the handful of unique, genre-defying artists before him, Alex' uncompromising ""go your own road"" approach was difficult and lonely at first, but is now beginning to pay dividends.</p><p>From his earliest years in Artemisa, he was immersed in music. Alex's first stage appearance on national TV was at the tender age of four, playing claves (a percussion instrument) in a group directed by his music instructor father. Alex went on to study guitar, tres, percussion and bass, practicing eight hours a day during his teens.</p><p>After a stint with his twin brother Adonis to record Morumba Cubana, as The Puentes Brothers, Alex departed from Cuban music norms to follow his own path. His debut CD with the Alex Cuba Band, ""Humo De Tabaco"", earned him a Juno award for World Music Album in 2006, with the single ""Lo Mismo Que Yo"", featuring Ron Sexsmith charting in the Top 20 at BBC Radio 2. For ""Humo"", Alex took UK producer Martin Terefe to Cuba to record the album's funk infused horns and percussion, a sound that got under Terefe's skin. By extension, that ""Alex*Cuba sound"" is now evident on Terefe's productions for Craig David, Ron Sexsmith and Jason Mraz.</p><p>After a musical and spiritual evolution, Cuba returned to the studio, this time with co-producer Joby Baker of Victoria, to record ""Agua Del Pozo"" which was released in Canada in February 2007 under his own Caracol Records imprint. Acclaimed for its blend of tempo, instrumentation and songwriting, the album is a clear evolution from the debut, punctuated by the introduction of Alex's electric guitar, a vintage Gibson. With the soul-pop sensibility of tracks like ""Si Pero No"", the album revealed Alex' Latin Soul DNA.  The song, which was an iTunes Single of the Week in Japan, proved to be huge with fans and confounded radio programmers who didn't know which format in which to program it. ""Agua"" earned Alex his second Juno Award for Best World Music album 2008. ""Agua Del Pozo"" was released in the U.S. with two unreleased tracks on September 22, 2009 to fan and critical acclaim alike.</p><p>In the digital space, Alex*Cuba has had four iTunes Singles of the Week (Canada, U.S., Japan, Netherlands), has charted on various iTunes charts in Canada, the U.S. and Japan and has independently built an impressive, loyal online community around the world.</p><p>Alex recently collaborated with Nelly Furtado for her Spanish language debut album ""Mi Plan"" (My Plan) which was released September 2009 around the world (Universal). The creative chemistry between Alex, Nelly and James Bryan was magical and resulted in nine co-writes including the 1 single ""Manos Al Aire"" (Hands in the Air) and the title track where he appears as an invited guest on vocals. A prolific songwriter, Alex is continues working on new collaborations with writers and artists on various projects.</p><p>In between tour dates and the Nelly Furtado collaborations, Alex recorded his third album at Baker Studios in Victoria, B.C. The self-titled project was released October 27th, 2009 in Canada and the U.S. release is slated for June 8th, 2010. Featuring surprising new grooves, innovative electric guitar inflections and varying tempos and structures, the album is an important step in Alex Cuba's ongoing musical revolution. The first single ""Caballo"" (Horse), a Cuban-funk-rocker, was also made into video conceived and produced in Smithers. Other highlights are ""Solo Tu"" (Only You), a moving, mid-tempo rock ballad, ""Tierra Colora"" (Red Soil), a samba-rock-surf-punk sizzler and the funked up ""If You Give Me Love"", Alex' first-ever song in English, which was recently serviced to radio, video and online outlets in Canada. The album was just released in the U.S. to acclaim by media outlets and his growing, loyal fan community. Early radio accolades for the album include an NPR ""First Listen"" feature, an ""Album Of The Week"" feature at Jazz FM UK, a glowing Billboard review and lead-off track ""Directo"" was selected as KCRW's ""Today's Top Tune.""</p><p>Critical to Alex' success has been constant touring with a live show that has been described as explosive. Again, his visionary rebel nature is revealed in the fact that contrary to the prevailing Cuban and Latin big band formations, Alex Cuba performs as a trio (Alex on vocals, electric and acoustic guitars, electric bass and drums). The simplicity, power, and sheer efficiency of this formation has stolen the stage from bands quadruple their size and has confused many production teams expecting the typical big band at load-in. Doing more with less is an ever-present mantra for Alex*Cuba.</p><p>With a heart as big as his retro 'fro, Cuba takes it all in stride and focuses on what he does best: crafting songs that cut through linguistic and cultural barriers like a machete through sugarcane.</p><p>...Go with the &lsquo;Fro!</p>",,,,,2028,Daniel Cho Benefit Concert,,http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/event.php?eid=154271871259099,,,7355,"<p><strong>Featuring: <a href=""http://www.euphonism.com/"" target=""_blank"">Euphonism</a>, <a href=""http://www.catesong.com/"" target=""_blank"">Cate Song</a>, and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/leftonvermont"" target=""_blank"">Left On Vermont</a></strong></p><p>Daniel Cho was known to the rest of the world as a successful studio and touring musician, as well as being a blogger for ESPN's Soccernet.

Continuing to turn out great work, of course. Growing artistically. Challenging expectations. And how about acting your age: embracing experience rather than trying to airbrush it?</p><p>Among rock musicians who matter, no one has check-listed those items more winningly than Peter Himmelman. During his multi-pronged career as a singer, songwriter and all-around performer, as a children's entertainer, TV and film composer and pioneering webcast star, he has maintained remarkably high standards: Can you point to a song in his vast body of work that feels tossed off, or remember a concert or club date that didn't delight and amuse? Is there a pop star of his generation more committed to exploring new modes of expression and new methods of connecting with his diehard followers?</p><p>Recorded on a dare - his own - to work faster and more under the gun, and closer to the quick of the creative process, Himmelman's new Himmasongs album, ""The Mystery and the Hum,"" tumbled out of him with no planning or preparation. Holed up in a Minneapolis studio, far from the comforts of his home in Santa Monica, Calif., this native of St. Louis Park, MN, wrote the tunes over a two-week period and cut them in three days. Though he co-produced them with his friend Rob Genedek, who operates the studio, he raised the stakes of his experiment by hooking up with ""house"" musicians with whom he had never played, taking it on trust that if bassist Jim Anton and drummer Billy Thommes were good enough to run with Jonny Lang, they were good enough to ride the sonic rapids with him.</p><p>As the songs emerged, ranging from the irresistibly catchy love song ""Change My Channel"" to the earthy blues narrative ""Georgia Clay"" to the wryly observant ""Medicine,"" Himmelman knew they were winners. What he didn't know, having knocked them out so unselfconsciously, is what they meant. Like DNA samples, they needed to be analyzed. To paraphrase a line from one of his tunes, they knew him better than he did.</p><p>Ultimately, great artists are more than the sum of their recordings. More than the sum of their performances. More than the sum of their press clippings (speaking of which: ""Himmelman writes songs with the same emphatic edge and aesthetic urgency that impelled the Lost Generation to write novels"" - Time Magazine; ""One of rock's most wildly imaginative performers"" - USA Today). What becomes an artist of Himmelman's stature most is continuing to reach deep inside for answers to life's mysteries, while continuing to reach out to listeners. Himmelman may not have the mystique of his father-in-law Bob Dylan or the swagger or hipitude of some of his contemporaries. But his honesty and soul-searching intensity make him one of the most treasured rock musicians of his era.</p><p>As convenient as it is to categorize him as a singer-songwriter, it is as a singersongwriter-husband-father-son-supplicant that Himmelman has left his mark. His devotion to his wife and four children is its own work of art. At critical junctures in his career, he has resisted pressure to stay on the road flogging an album and returned home to raise his kids instead. To make it easier to navigate between touring and homebodying, he has performed more frequently as a solo act. The first highly recognized (and highly applauded) Observant Jew since Sandy Koufax, he has refused to perform on Friday nights, when the Jewish Sabbath begins. What pop artist would turn down a guest shot on ""The Tonight Show"" (which he did more than once) for religious reasons?</p><p>Himmelman makes no bones about being torn over the career sacrifices he has made in the name of family. Even knowing he made the morally appropriate decision in putting his wife and children first didn't ease his sense of regret over the chances at greater fame and commercial success he had missed. But if some artists can resist the pull of their little boy or girl crying on the phone from thousands of miles away, begging ""Daddy, come home,"" he was - is - constitutionally unwilling.</p><p>In the post-9/11 world, his songs have gotten darker, losing some of the idealism of earlier efforts including his much-loved ""Woman with the Strength of 10,000 Men"" (based on an encounter with an ALS survivor who could communicate only with her eyebrows). A few years ago, Himmelman was in a serious funk. Between albums, dulled by the strain and monotony of TV work, and unsure as to where to go next, he found himself reading and thinking about Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter executed by Arab extremists for no other reason than being Jewish. He regretted that he had never met Pearl, or become friends with him, or performed for him. Then a friend sent him an article in which it was revealed that Pearl had been a fan of his - that, in fact, Himmelman was his favorite artist. Himmelman also was stunned to learn from the author of the article, a longtime friend of Pearl, that he and Danny had bonded over Himmelman's songs and had come backstage to meet him following a 1995 show in at the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C. Himmelman, he said, gave each of them a broken string as a souvenir.</p><p>The revelations proved life-changing. ""The knowledge that my songs have had reach beyond what I could ever begin to imagine has made me less concerned about the difficult choices I've made and focused me with a greater sense of mission,"" said Himmelman, who has become close with Pearl's parents, Judea and Ruth Pearl. ""Sometimes when I write, I feel like I'm connecting with my Dad, who died many years ago, or my sister, who died six years ago in a car crash in Wisconsin, or Danny Pearl, with whom I'm strangely forging some kind of Earthly/heavenly relationship.""</p><p>The unfathomable loss of Daniel Pearl resonates in the strange cry that rises from ""Raining Down from Satellite,"" a new song that muses on the sad global divisions technology seems to only widen. ""The Mystery and the Hum"" is frequently about distance and detachment, opening twangily with a guy holed up in a ""Motel Room in Davenport,"" ""waiting on a resurrection,"" and ending movingly with a lonely soul in an empty house yearning for lost connections, feeling the ""Trembling in the Beams."" As moody as it is, ""The Mystery and the Hum"" may be the most radio-friendly of all Himmelman's albums, for which he gives credit to the friend who mixed it, veteran producer Don Smith (Rolling Stones, Tom Petty, U2), whose recent death was a major blow. As always, Himmelman's belief in the power of love, and the power of music, to lift us above and beyond our circumstances shines its special, uplifting light.</p><p>If anyone can call the performance stage home away from home, it is Himmelman. Many fans prefer his solo shows because there's no band to get in the way of his improvised verbal riffs and hilarious back and forth banter with the audience. Unlike such celebrated rock wits as Randy Newman and Warren Zevon, he keeps humor out of his songs, preferring to use it as a ""counterbalance"" to the serious themes in them. There's Himmelman the singer and Himmelman the comic. ""Sometimes they duke it out with one another on stage,"" he says approvingly.</p><p>For fans of Himmelman the comic, his groundbreaking webcast, ""Peter Himmelman's Furious World,"" is manna from heaven. Originating from his Santa Monica studio (and accessible at peterhimmelman.com), the newfangled variety program features live music and spoken bits by the host (joined by his cast of regulars), off-the-wall videos, and guest performers. ""Furious World"" has featured acclaimed veterans such as Joe Henry and Michael McDermott, up-and-comers such as Joe Firstman and Raining Jane and compelling non-musicians such as Judea Pearl, a scientist/philosopher, humorist, Sandra Tsing Loh, and Jeff ""the Dude"" Dowd - inspiration for the Coen Brothers' film, ""The Big Lebowski."" A second webcast, ""Peter Himmelman's Curious World,"" is aimed at kids, for whom Himmelman has recorded five albums - among them, ""My Green Kite,"" which was nominated for a Grammy. ""I'm as proud of those albums as anything I've done,"" he says.</p><p>Himmelman started his first band in sixth grade, and, armed with the red Fender Duo-Sonic his father bought for him from his cousin, led several others in junior high. A Jewish kid among gentiles, a boy with curly brown hair in the land of uncurled Scandinavian blonds, an introspective soul among jocks, he found escape in black culture: in funk and R&amp;B, reggae and blues. During 11th grade, he auditioned for R&amp;B star Alexander O'Neill, an original member of The Time. Before his senior year was out, he was playing lead guitar and writing songs for Shangoya, a legendary local band with Caribbean origins. ""Maybe because I write songs and talk too much, it's easy for people to forget that at the root of it all, I'm a guitarist,"" said Himmelman, a cutting soloist inspired by Jimi Hendrix, Taj Mahal, John Lee Hooker and Luther Allison.</p><p>He first made a serious noise with his power-pop unit Sussman Lawrence, which released a pair of well-received albums in 1980 and 1984, respectively. But it was his 1985 solo debut, ""This Father's Day,"" the moving title song of which was written following his dad's death, that announced him as a special kind of artist. It led to his first major-label effort, ""Gematria,"" the title of which comes from a system used by rabbis to interpret scripture by assigning numerical values to words and letters. He has soared ever-higher in that special place where romantic and spiritual expression meet - and where it's sometimes difficult to separate one from the other - on a succession of acclaimed albums including ""Synesthesia,"" ""From Strength to Strength,"" ""Flown This Acid World,"" the bold conceptual effort ""Skin,"" ""Love Thinketh No Evil,"" ""Unstoppable Forces,"" ""Imperfect World"" and ""The Pigeons Couldn't Sleep.""</p><p>(Ever generous, he also has made available, in some cases as free bonuses, 11 volumes of previously unreleased songs from the ""Himmelvaults"" and other rarities including ""Blackout In the Book of Light,"" an album he recorded years back with a name producer but didn't like enough to put out then.)</p><p>There has been plenty else to keep him busy. In addition to his soundtrack composing (his TV shows have included ""Judging Amy,"" for which he received a Grammy nomination for the song, ""The Best Kind of Answer,"" and the Fox hit, ""Bones""), he has written music for commercials, fashion shows and a Teddy Bear used with rape victims and autistic kids and penned songs, ""like Cyrano, for lonely, speechless men to woo unwilling lovers."" Himmelman also is an increasingly prolific visual artist whose work has been purchased by art collectors the world over.</p><p>He's never in danger of not working on something. ""My Mother tells me,"" he says, ""that when she gave birth to me in 1959 without any anesthesia whatsoever - a completely natural childbirth - there was a group of medical students watching the delivery and that they actually applauded when I emerged. You could say I was born to be onstage.""</p>",http://www.peterhimmelman.com/music.html,,,,2024,Eric Himan,,,,,0,,,,,,2023,Levi Kreis,,,,http://www.levikreis.com,6974,,,,,,2018,That 1 Guy (kids show!),http://www.myspace.com/that1guy,http://www.facebook.com/that1guy,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XHt32UVqLk,http://www.that1guy.com,6965,"<p>""Funky Bean,"" ""Buttmachine,"" Mustaches and Laser beams. It reads like a page out of a Dr. Seuss book, but for Mike Silverman, better known as That 1 Guy, it is just the reality he was searching for.</p><p>At 150-200 live shows each year people gather to see his mad scientist at work, curiously watching as That 1 Guy plugs an electric chord into the heel of a cowboy boot and transforms it into an instrument. He howls and the audience joins him like a pack of coyotes. They even chime in for the song ""Weasel Pot Pie,"" offering rhymes to finish a line about ""cinnamon scones"": Twilight Zones? Al Capones? Frank Stallones? That 1 Guy laughs and offers the grin of a Cheshire cat. Here is a man who loves his job.</p><p>Silverman's back story is not dissimilar to other musicians: he grew up a music geek, influenced by his jazz musician father, and enrolled in San Francisco Conservatory of Music before joining the jazz scene himself as a sought-after percussive bassist. This is where the similarities end, though, and where That 1 Guy began. ""In my case, being a bass player, I just felt very restricted by the instrument itself,"" he says. ""I've always wanted to sound different and have my own sound. I was headed that way on the bass, but for me to fully realize what I was hearing in my head sonically I was going to have to do it my way.""</p><p>That 1 Guy set off on his own, challenging the idea of what a one-man band can and should be. Rather than altering and adding on to the bass, he started from scratch, conceptualizing and creating the Magic Pipe. Standing at seven-feet-tall, the collection of swiveling pipes, metal gears, bass strings and electronic buttons forms the shape of a harp, but is played like a futuristic gutbucket.</p><p>With his curious instrument, creative performances and abundant talent, That 1 Guy soon caught the attention of promoters around the world and began touring heavily, wowing crowds at Big Day Out, Glastonbury, Monterrey Jazz Festival, Lowlands, Wakarusa and numerous other festivals. In 2007 he joined Guns &lsquo;N' Roses guitarist Buckethead on an American tour before headlining his own ""Mustaches and Laser Beams"" tour through North America.</p><p>Despite a demanding tour schedule, That 1 Guy has no plans on slowing down in 2010. His latest album PACKS A WALLOP! brings a new dimension to his work, thanks to new sounds and a new partnership with famed sound engineer Billy Hume (Nelly, Shop Boyz, Ying Yang Twins). Recorded at Hume's studio in Atlanta, GA, PACKS A WALLOP! stretches That 1 Guy's soundscapes further than ever, seamlessly combining hard-hitting rock (""Modern Man""), swampy blues (""Step Into Striped Light"") and electronic groove (""Funk Bean""). Hume's influence brings greater depth to the low frequencies and heavy beats. ""I'm really proud of what we did with the album,"" says That 1 Guy. ""It sounds closer to what I've been trying to do sonically since I started.""</p><p>This accomplishment required a new creative process. Whereas his last two albums, The Moon is Disgusting (2006) and Songs in the Key of Beotch (2000, re-released in 2004) were created from songs that he had already performed, That 1 Guy went into The Zone with nothing but ideas, sleeping on a mattress upstairs so he could sneak in to the studio whenever he felt inspired. ""I went in there with zero - nothing finished - and I lived at the studio for a month. It was really hard work, really long days, and I forced myself to craft some stuff."" The spontaneity, coupled with a tight window for completing the album, made all the difference.</p><p>""Human beings do our best work when we're challenged and pushed up against the wall,"" That 1 Guy explains. ""By nature, we're hunters and gathers, spending each day looking for next meal. It's easy to be lazy when you don't have to come up with something creative right away.""</p><p>His creativity continues with a new tour in support of PACKS A WALLOP! Along with the Magic Pipe, expect to see the Magic Saw and Magic Flute, as well as magic tricks. ""I had never seen a magic show until about two years ago,"" That 1 Guy confesses. ""I had no interest in it-but now I just love it. I'm like a twelve-year-old,"" incorporating magic tricks seamlessly into live performances, even using a playing card in place of a traditional pick. ""So much of my music has miraculous qualities to it because it's hard to tell what's going on. There are lots of slights of hand and sonic misdirection. It feels like I was meant to do magic.""</p><p>Strange? Perhaps. But as Billboard noted, ""In the case of Mike Silverman's slamming, futuristic funk act... the normal rules of biology just don't apply."" It suits That 1 Guy just fine.</p><p>""I like being my own person,"" he says. ""I didn't set out to be a weirdo but I'm starting to embrace it.""</p>",,,,,2016,Council Bluffs,http://www.myspace.com/councilbluffsmusic,http://www.facebook.com/councilbluffs,,,7101,"<p>Washington, DC-based original alternative rock band Council Bluffs plays music focused on driving instrumentation and catchy guitar and vocal hooks.

The very name strikes a chord. Your mind begins to wander...and then wonder: it is seemingly English sounding but resonates with a foreign reverberation all at the same time. That best describes the music group going by this appellation, though.</p><p>Lilyphone is guaranteed to be one of the freshest sensations to ever arrive on the music scene. Currently residing in Copenhagen, Denmark, the band consists of lead singer and main songwriter Marie Keis Uhre who also plays the dobro, drummer Thomas Steen Hansen, bass player Henrik Steen, and lead guitar Jakob Haugb&oslash;lle Thomhav. The three guys not only sing back up but also help in the arrangement of songs.</p><p>Speaking of tunes, theirs are all original. They are written about life experiences which are deeply personal and yet completely universal. Lilyphone has the international sound that appeals to a global audience which makes their performance itinerary boundless.</p><p>Having met at the Music Conservatory in Copenhagen in 2001, Lilyphone emerged as a basement band; however, as time passed and the group became top priority for each member, they were discovered by producer Rogers Masson. Masson, who has worked with a myriad of artists ranging from Eric Clapton and Marilyn Manson to Day of Fire, began recording and mixing the songs. Masson states, ""When I first heard Lilyphone I knew I was witnessing something truly unique and artistically special. The sound is so rich and vibrant, so completely full of life that it welcomes you in like family, and draws you close like love. This group, and how their songs speak, has fundamentally changed the way I look at music and approach recording.""</p><p>The sound is indeed unique and that made their Nashville showcase in 2008 an enormous success. It resulted in many offers before Lilyphone signed an exclusive booking agreement with APA Talent Agency. With major offices in Beverly Hills, New York and Nashville, APA is one of the largest full service talent &amp; literary agencies in the U.S. J. R. Montes, the band's agent at APA comments, ""We are proud to represent Lilyphone. The band's solid work ethic, soulful lyrics and dynamic live show make them a perfect fit for our roster, and we look forward to a long, rewarding relationship with the band.""</p><p>Dan Keen, a vice president with ASCAP, is likewise one of their most loyal fans. ""I am over the moon for this group and will rest with nothing less than making Lilyphone a household word,"" states Keen from his Nashville office.</p><p>Marie attests, ""We know we are on the right track as a band and now have surrounded ourselves with a great team, but most importantly, we are all following our dreams and that is never a futile enterprise.</p>",,,,,2002,FIVES,,http://www.facebook.com/fivesband,,http://Fivesband.com/,9278,"<p>FIVES is a progressive blend of rock, blues and acoustic music, combining intertwining melodies with creative and pertinent lyrics.

It is, in itself, a chimera; a fabulous creature made with parts of two distinctly different creatures. It is also an acronym, as you might guess from its being capitalized like that. By virtue of being a friend to, and fan of, both the zygotes in this organism, I know what its letters stand for, but it's not mine to reveal. I expect they will do so at some future point.</p><p>Having driven my Ducati to Sean and Kemp's house through the darkened October streets of 4 am New York to type these words, I realize the absurdity of my task. If I wrote a novel and gave its protagonists stories of origin like the ones from which the two parts of GOASTT arose, people would say I was a fabulist in need of a hyperboectomy. Or an artless sophomore. But life is allowed a liberty with plotlines that novelists are not. Take these two:</p><p>Sean Lennon is a man of many hats. Like an alien who fell to earth and had to quickly assimilate humanity, he is a vast rolodex of accents, facts, farce, a myriad of motor skills (from archery to sketching) and can play any musical instrument (as if all undertakings are merely transposable keys to a song he knows by heart). Hyper-aware, there's almost nothing he isn't good at... This may be the result of his legendary genetic endowment, or simply the enormous pressure of his parentage; his father was perhaps the most accessible and experimental songwriter of his century. But, just as he reached the age of 5 when his father might have reared him with the milk and honey of nurture rather than the iron fist of nature, Sean's father was assassinated. As a consequence of this huge event and other shadows, Sean's life has been strangely both circumscribed and exaggerated. To the insouciant improvisational ""Art is a Verb!"" nature of his parents was added a welter of natural anxieties that would have made Woody Allen feel at home.</p><p>When I briefly encountered Sean's mother as an avant garde artist at Wesleyan University in January of 1966, I thought she had the most original mind I'd ever met. Later as she was dragged across the yawning screen of American hypercelebrity, I didn't know what to think, save that she, and all around her, seemed improbable.</p><p>And improbable was the first word that came to mind when I met Kemp Muhl almost exactly 40 years later.</p><p>Though her background was as unlikely as Sean's, hers was as private in its peculiarities as his was public. And her origins as the Georgian daughter of a military lieutenant colonel who had been nipped off to be a supermodel in New York, at about the tender age improbably beautiful girls are usually abducted - which is, chronologically at least, almost criminally young - did not in any way explain the fact that she has the other most original mind I had ever encountered.</p><p>After meeting Kemp, I followed her around- to the extent that I could move quickly enough- not, like most others, for the scenery, but because I found her casual triple-entendres, her ""Kempisms,"" to be so improbably delicious in my mind...</p><p>She is such a free-running spring of cool creativity, that it didn't surprise me much when, shortly after she paired off with Sean and began to experience the musical ecosystem that is his unique mind, she revealed herself to have an utterly original sense of melody and lyrical realization as well. Her lines are like Borges short stories. I might have known.</p><p>As a symbol of her transformation for Sean, she now goes by Charlotte (her first name), much like a Native American who gets a new name upon having killed their first buffalo. Erstwhile Sean, (since his past chapters of turmoil and Shakespearean tragedy,) has shed the dark scales of his brooding artist skin for that of a newfound composer and puckish poet of an invincible fiber.</p><p>My great fortune lies in being an audience very close at hand to the gestation, birth, and early being of The GOASST. It is beautiful and strange and new. Let us watch it grow together.""<em> -John Perry Barlow</em></p>",,,,,1995,Ingram Hill,,http://www.facebook.com/ingramhillmusic,http://www.youtube.com/user/ingramhillfan,http://www.rockridgemusic.com/ingramhill/,16598,"<p>Memphis-based rock trio Ingram Hill would probably love to have it look as if their latest album, ""Look Your Best,"" was as easy-breezy to create as the lyrics suggest, but lead singer/guitarist Justin Moore says it was made with a great deal of hard work, determination, and grit. Ingram Hill has toured extensively with bands such as Hootie and the Blowfish, Johnny Lang, Maroon 5, Guster, Better Than Ezra, and Hanson. Says Bogard of their live vibe: ""It's a feel-good, good time show. The goal is a good, old-fashioned, rock &Atilde;&sbquo;&Acirc;&lsquo;n' roll show."" While they count bands as diverse as Pink Floyd, Elvis Presley, Elton John, and Aerosmith as personal influences, the band's sound is much more current. Rock Ridge Music signed the band to a label and management deal earlier in 2010 and released ""Look Your Best"" in September 2010. Contrary to what some might assume, Ingram Hill is not of the name of a solo artist but rather, a band; no one in Ingram Hill is actually named Ingram Hill (just like there was never a musician named Lynard Skynard or Jethro Tull - at least not in either of those well-known '70s bands). Like Cracker, Train, and Tonic, Ingram Hill has an earthy, unpretentious approach that is relevant to both alternative pop/rock and roots rock. The Memphis-based foursome aren't an exact replica of classic rockers from the '60s and '70s - their work is more modern - but they do have a certain down-home rootsiness that has gone over well in Southern rock circles.</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/ingram-hill/id5308452?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/ingramhill,,1992,The Slow Learners,,,,,0,,,,,,1990,Howie Day,http://www.myspace.com/howieday,http://www.facebook.com/howieday,http://www.youtube.com/howiedaytv,http://www.howieday.com,6858,"<p>Several years after releasing his commercial breakthrough album Stop All The World Now, singer and songwriter Howie Day breaks his silence with his long-awaited third studio album Sound the Alarm. The album is a stunning collection of the kind of emotionally resonant, melody-minded pop-rock gems that have earned Day a legion of devoted fans over the past 10 years. Sound the Alarm comes after more than a decade of touring, during which the Bangor, Maine, native self-released his 2000 debut Australia and became a full-time traveling musician. He became known for his powerful one-man shows, connecting with audiences through his charm, humor, the strength of his songwriting, and a warm tenor voice that ""soars into fluttering, high registers, but also grates with real, pleading grit,"" as one critic put it.</p><p>After selling nearly 50,000 copies of Australia on his own, Day, then 21, signed to Epic Records. Epic re-issued the album, which went on to sell 300,000 copies. In 2003, Day released his major-label debut, Stop All The World Now, and hit the road to support it. The constant touring paid off big-time: Stop was certified gold in the U.S. and spawned two Top 10 radio hits: ""She Says"" and the platinum smash hit ""Collide."" ""Collide"" became inescapable; it was featured in scores of TV shows, including Grey's Anatomy and Scrubs, as well as in a variety of films. The track became Epic Records' first platinum single, eventually selling 1.5 million downloads. But despite all of this success, Day's demanding touring and promotional schedule took a heavy toll.</p><p>""I was just physically and mentally burnt out,"" Day says. ""I toured for five years straight before Stop All The World Now came out, then for three years non-stop after it was released. Around the same time the album was becoming successful, my family was struck with tragedy. It was a period of clearly defined extremes, which plays with your head a bit."" Day decided to take some time off, during which he sorted through his emotions by writing songs, many of which have made their way onto Sound the Alarm.</p><p>""The new album very obviously echoes my own life, in all of its highs and lows, but not all of it is explicitly autobiographical,"" Day says. ""Some of the songs draw inspiration from people and places I've observed, and then bits of my own experiences find their way in. People often ask me what certain songs are about, and it's like, Well, I don't know, it's a story that just happened subconsciously. I didn't resist it or fight it. In a simple way, the album is a post-coming-of age story about that dream-like period of your early 20s, when you're trying to figure out how grown up you actually want to be. But in the process of all of that moving around during the recording, the album became a diary of those experiences as well.""</p><p>The sound of the album beautifully underscores its emotionally complex spirit. Bold, textured arrangements - flush with acoustic and electric guitars, keyboards, strings, and samples - capture a range of moods from upbeat and playful (first single ""Be There,"" ""Undressed"") to introspective (""40 Hours,"" ""Everyone Loves To Love a Lie"") to atmospheric (""So Stung,"" ""Counting On Me"") to downright heartbreaking (""Sound the Alarm,"" ""No Longer What You Require""). ""Initially, I wrote a bunch of pretty sad songs about loss and relationships gone wrong, and then realized I didn't want to put out an entirely depressing album because that's no longer where I'm at,"" Day says. ""So I deliberately threw a few in the mix that were a bit more light and up-tempo, like &lsquo;Weightless' and &lsquo;Undressed,' I think if there are too many similar songs on an album all in a row, they lose their identity because there's no contrast.""</p><p>But even Sound the Alarm's heaviest songs build lyrically and musically toward uplifting conclusions. ""Be There,"" which addresses the struggle to remain in a relationship, ends with the optimistic urge to give it a go, while the title track, a song about deep loss, concludes with the hopeful refrain: ""I know we'll make it right / We'll be all right...""</p><p>To get the range of sounds and moods he was looking for, Day recorded in a variety of locations, including Los Angeles, New York, London, Minneapolis, and Bloomington, Indiana, between the spring of 2006 and fall of 2008. ""I wanted to bring a sense of different places thematically and emotionally from one track to the next, and physically moving everyone around during the tracking process accomplished that,"" Day explains. He also collaborated with several musicians and producers, including Martin Terefe (Jason Mraz, KT Tunstall), Mike Denneen (Aimee Mann, Fountains of Wayne), Mike Flynn (The Fray, Augustana), and Better Than Ezra frontman Kevin Griffin - each one of them an expert in pulling superlative performances out of the artists they work with.</p><p>Sound the Alarm retains and builds on the appeal of its predecessor, showcasing an artist who has dealt with a lot in his past and is focused on moving forward. ""This new album represents the end of one era and the start of another,"" Day says. ""It's about tipping your hat to the past, living in the here and now, and looking optimistically toward the future.""</p>",,,,,1988,Susan Cowsill,http://www.myspace.com/susancowsill,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Susan-Cowsill/60295999720?ref=ts,http://susancowsill.com/audiovideo,http://susancowsill.com,6856,"<p>""'From Katrina to Super Bowl champs, this is our story,' singer-songwriter and proud New Orleans resident Susan Cowsill writes in the credits, and she repeatedly veers between drowning and daylight, exile and homecoming, on Lighthouse, an earthy, often crunchy folk-pop gem.

As a performer, Reed approaches each song with nothing less than utter conviction; he's as authentically gritty as he is ingratiatingly sexy. Reed incorporates the feel of classic R&amp;B and soul into a largely self-penned, 12-song set, produced with Mike Elizondo, the bassist-turned-producer whose credits include, among others, Eminem, Pink, Gwen Stefani and Fiona Apple. Admirers have likened Reed to such luminaries as Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett; the Boston Herald called him ""Boston's answer to Sam Cooke."" But he's not merely trying to recreate a sound; Reed is channeling his influences and inspirations into making something all his own.</p><p>""For me,"" says Reed, ""it's all about writing pop songs. Soul music was the greatest pop music of the 20th century and its influence is so far-reaching. When I pick up a guitar to write a song, the influence of the music I love invariably comes out. For me, that music has been completely internalized. I'm not trying to put anything on; this is what comes out, this is what happens, I can't sing or write any other way than I do.""</p><p>""I try to write from phrases that I think people will respond to,"" Reed explains. ""Turns of phrase are very important to me,"" a point illustrated most potently on his song ""Name Calling"" (lyric: ""You went from name calling to calling my name""). ""I'm very inspired by Sam Cooke in that way and I learned a lot from country music too. To be able to create a mental picture for someone with just one line is very, very important. Sam Cooke talks about writing from conversation, personal stories, little turns of phrase that catch your ear and you can make a hook out of. That's my songwriting m.o..""</p><p>Most of the material on Come And Get It, Reed says, ""was written at home, when I was messing around on the acoustic guitar."" The title song began quickly when Reed's guitarist Ryan Spraker, who co-wrote several numbers, dreamed up the title phrase, ""If You Want The Love of A Man, Come and Get It."" But, says Reed, ""That one actually took a little while because we wanted to get the sentiment across correctly without sounding cheesy."" As for the subject matter he favors - finding, seeking and holding onto love - Reed admits ""I like writing love songs because they are easy for people to relate to and mostly it's what I tend to understand and those are the kind of sentiments I come up with. Some of my songs come from personal experience, some of them are changed, just ideas that come to me, as most songwriting works.""</p><p>The opening track ""Young Girl"" is a tribute to little-known Boston soul singer Frank Lynch, who died tragically just as his career looked like it would take off with the release of this song. That's part of Reed's m.o. too: going back to the source of his own inspiration, finding unsung veteran artists and bringing them along with him, however he can. This past summer Reed helped organize the Brooklyn Soul Festival, featuring under-recognized soul legends like Barbara Lynn, Roscoe Robinson, and Otis Clay, in the borough he now calls home.</p><p>While he was making Come and Get It, says Reed, ""I was listening to a lot of late sixties, early seventies soul music from Chicago, in particular Mel and Tim and Tyrone Davis. It's all very lavishly produced stuff, a lot of horns, a lot of strings, but it's also really tough, the rhythm section is always really funky. I was going for that sort of vibe. That was the plan.""</p><p>Producer Elizondo came at R&amp;B from a markedly different angle than Reed, having deep roots in hip hop as well as contemporary rock. Says Reed, ""It was definitely a different thing for him and it was a different thing for me, to work with a strong-minded producer, but it didn't take him long to earn my respect. When we were cutting the string section he'd have the score laid out on the board, following along. He's say, &lsquo;measure 76, second violin, that note is flat.' That is very impressive. Mike's got great ideas and he's got great ears, and he's a great bass player. I definitely have a pop sensibility, but he brought more of an understanding of modern music.""</p><p>Even as a youngster, Reed displayed unusually sophisticated - and good - taste, working his way through his dad's formidable record collection from the moment he learned to work a turntable. Reed absorbed early rock and roll (Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, The Coasters) before moving on to the Country radio hits of the day. (The first record he bought was Travis Tritt and Marty Stuart's single, ""The Whiskey Ain't Workin'"" - ""I still think it's really good,"" Reed interjects.) Then he fell for Howlin' Wolf and the blues. However, the defining moment in Reed's youthful musical education came when his dad bought Atlantic's Ray Charles boxed set on cassette: ""That was my introduction into soul music, it really changed my life. During one summer vacation, when we were in the car, we listened to those three tapes over and over again.""</p><p>Along with passing on the record-collecting bug, his dad also gave him a harmonica, the first instrument Reed learned to play. In high school, he hung out in the band room with students as passionate about music as he was: ""Most of them were way better musicians than me; I wasn't very good at the time as a guitarist. I played tenor sax, too - but I wasn't very good at that either."" But he harbored a gift as one powerhouse singer. At a Martin Luther King Day assembly, he performed ""A Change Is Gonna Come."" As he recalls, ""Everyone freaked out, I got a standing ovation.""</p><p>From there, his path to a professional career was built on movie script-worthy twists and surprises. His love of the music (and a series of amazing coincidences) brought him to Clarksdale, Mississippi. After having just graduated high school at the age of 18, Reed was frequenting juke joints and lounges and playing the blues five nights a week. He found mentors among the veteran players like Terry ""Big T"" Williams, Sam Carr, and Wesley ""Junebug"" Jefferson, and honed his skills as a fledgling performer in a fertile but unforgiving environment. When he wasn't ""on"" during a gig, fellow musicians and onlookers told him in no uncertain terms that he'd have to leave the stage. But the baby-faced young man from Boston had guts to match his chops: ""It was hard. I had never been away from home before. I learned a lot about growing up.""</p><p>He returned north with new skills, and a new nickname - Paperboy: ""I used to wear this hat, my grandfather's hat, a newsboy hat - it's retired now. All the musicians in Clarksdale had a nickname. They gave me that one and it stuck with me.""</p><p>Reed did subsequently try college, getting accepted into the University of Chicago, but once again, he was drawn more to music than books, hosting a well-regarded Southern Soul show on the college radio station and exploring Chicago's south-side for records and fried chicken. Given his fascination with the lesser known but seriously influential figures in R&amp;B, he tracked down a former Chess Records artist named Mitty Collier (""I Had a Talk With My Man Last Night""), who'd given up soul-singing for the ministry. She not only befriended Reed but hired him to play keyboards and sing at her Sunday services, paying him a small stipend that he poured back into expanding his record collection.</p><p>He returned to Boston after the school year ended, determined to put together his own band. For a time he worked for a band mate's florist mom, using her van to transport gear as well as to deliver floral arrangements. Reed put out two very well received albums while in Boston. His first - Sings Walkin' and Talkin' and Other Smash Hits! was independently released and the follow-up Roll With You was released by Boston's Q Division Records. In the US, Rolling Stone named Reed a ""Breaking Artist,"" praising his ""howling grooves and dirty down home R&amp;B."" In the UK, Reed received a nomination at the 2009 MOJO Awards for Breakthrough Artist of the Year. The thunderous buzz eventually brought him to the attention of Capitol Records.<br />""People say you make your own luck,"" Reed concludes. ""I've definitely made it a point to seek some of these people out who've inspired me, but some of the things that have happened so far have just been amazing - and I have been unbelievably lucky that they've happened.""</p><p>After listening to Come and Get It, it's clear that the rest of us are about to become the lucky ones.</p>",,,,,1972,Silly Bus,http://www.myspace.com/sillybus,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Silly-Bus/108852387721,http://www.youtube.com/user/SillyBusVideo,http://www.sillybus.net,6791,"<p>Silly Bus is a two-time Mom's Choice Award winner and a member of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Science, famous for its Grammy Awards.

Feeling that this was to become much more than a hobby, at the age of 14 they made the mature decision to put together a band. Turning to longtime gal pal Jess Bowen, who was playing drums in the school band, they began setting the roots for The Summer Set. As soon as they met vocalist Brian Dales and guitarist Josh Montgomery in 2007, they knew the quintet was complete. Not only did they share a passion for rocking out to fun, pop-punk tunes, inspired by local Arizona bands Jimmy Eat World and The Format, but more importantly, they shared a goal of going big-time. This wasn't some ""after- school"" project to pass the time, the 5 friends believed they had the goods to go all the way and have fun while doing it. ""We sat down the very first day we started our band and realized that there was a lot of negativity in the music scene, which was depressing,"" Bowen says. ""We just want to bring a positive vibe."" Plus they easily agreed on a band name by opening up an Atlas and (luckily) putting the pointer on Somerset, New Jersey.</p><p>It's that can-do attitude that has driven the quintet to sell 7,000 copies of their first EP Love The Love You Have, and an additional 11,000 copies of the EP ...In Color. The Summer Set is all about tactical planning, and they took theirs seriously. Like Generals going into battle, the band strategically planned each move, including a MySpace campaign that integrated becoming ""friends"" with bands they admired - which intuitively led to support from said bands' followers, giving The Summer Set a leg up. The not-yet-known band started to build steadily, with 8.5 million plays on MySpace and over 2.2 million profile views. Using the Internet to continually connect with fans, the band started to see results.</p><p>Not leaving a stone un-turned, the group also began booking their own gigs and playing locally, gathering a tried and true following. Playing with bands like The Cab, Sing It Loud, We Shot the Moon, Everybody Else, and Mercy Mercedes, The Summer Set held their own, cultivating their own audience that only seemed to get bigger at each show.</p><p>With all this momentum, The Summer Set is gearing up to release their first full-length album, Love Like This, on October 13, 2009, on Razor &amp; Tie. Produced by Matt Grabe (The Maine, A Rocket to the Moon, Greeley Estates), the new album features lead off single, ""Chelsea,"" written for actress Chelsea Staub. When lead singer Dales was first introduced to the Disney Channel JONAS actress last year by guitarist Josh Montgomery, it was practically love at first sight. So he wrote a song about his crush and played the catchy pop-punk anthem, ""Chelsea,"" at the Troubadour in Los Angeles last October during a gig with The Pink Spiders and<br />Sherwood. He immediately won over the fans... and Chelsea herself. Soon after, the two were officially dating. ""I think the song definitely helped me,"" Dales admits. ""So my advice to anybody is: When in doubt, write a song.""</p><p>The album also includes tracks with additional production by Matt Squire (3OH!3, Panic At the Disco, The Used) and a song co-written with writers/producers Sam Hollander and Dave Katz (Metro Station, Boys Like Girls, Katy Perry, Gym Class Heroes). In addition to ""Chelsea,"" Love Like This features the rock-driven ""Young,"" and the mellow ballad ""Where Are You Now?"" featuring Dia Frampton from Meg and Dia. Wisely knowing their young audience, but also aware of maturing with them, Dales comments, ""We really wanted to make an album where every song sounds a bit different than the previous one - something that our teen fan base can listen to and something my parents can listen to.""<br />To prepare for their fall release, The Summer Set took their high-energy set on the road this summer with The Cab, The Secret Handshake, A Rocket to the Moon, Anarbor, My Favorite Highway, and Eye Alaska. While the young band (they're all between 18 and 20 years old) rocks out like ol' pros on stage, once they step off stage, it's all about face time with the fans. They've been known to hang out at venues for hours on end to meet every one they can. ""Stick around and don't be scared to talk to us - we're here to talk to the kids because they're the ones supporting us and helping us do what we love to do. We want to meet them all,"" Bowen says.</p><p>Staying in touch with fans is super important to the band, even when they're not on tour: All five members are active on their own Twitter page and on the band's MySpace and Facebook pages, communicating with supporters on a daily basis.</p><p>""We're just five normal kids, who live normal lives making music that we love,"" Dales says. ""You can hear the fun on our record, but hopefully when people come to our shows, you can feel all the fun and love that we're putting out there and take part of that home with you.""<br />With songs that any one who ever went through the processes of growing up, loving some one, and wondering if you will end up together, can identify with, and power pop that is best defined as delicious ear candy, The Summer Set's first full length CD will have you on your feet, singing along, and for the heck of it, shining that cell phone.

His brand of Americana-Pop has garnered him much acclaim and a substantial fanbase that spans the country. Before Tyler Hilton wrote the songs that appear on his new album The Storms We Share he had never written anything but love songs. ""It's not that I was uninterested in things other than love, but it was love that made me want to write songs,"" the 26-year-old singer, songwriter, and guitarist says.

Indeed The Storms We Share is huge leap in the evolution of this young artist whose goal was to release a record that simply made people smile.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Ftyler-hilton%252Fid3854486%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/tylerhilton,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""233"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/3KjYgmnomP8"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""233"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/dIS5g26Bnso"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"1949,The Diggity Dudes CD Release,,http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Diggity-Dudes/203890214247,http://www.youtube.com/user/DiggityDudes,http://thediggitydudes.com/,17655,"<p>""When you say Diggity, we say Dude!""</p><p>The Diggity Dudes play hip music for hip kids and their equally hip parents.  A typical set covers everything from pet rocks to disco moves to science experiments to presidential physical fitness, all delivered via ultra-catchy melodies over funky and danceable grooves.  Interactive skits, audience participation and a lighthearted comedic twist are what make a Diggity Dudes show more than a show - it's truly an experience.  Ultimately, the Dudes are committed to helping provide all the young Dudes and Dudettes with an opportunity to experience the power and joy of a life enriched by music.</p><p>After many years of playing ""grown up music,"" Diggity Dudes Mike Hartsfield and Donny Atkins began writing a catalog of catchy songs for their kids.  The Dudes decided if their kids liked what they heard, others would too.  In December of 2009, Mike and Donny added Diggity Scott Milstead (a founding member of Carbon Leaf and their drummer for 15 yrs.) on drums &amp; percussion.  They immediately began work on what would become their debut album, My Science Project, which was released on June 5th, 2010 at Richmond's famed CMoR (Children's Museum of Richmond).  The positive response to the record has been far and wide, including reviews in both regional and national press (Richmond Family Magazine, zooglobble.com, OWTK.com) and radio play on WXPN's Kids' Place LIVE (Philadelphia).</p><p>2011 has been an incredible year of growth for the band.  In addition to a consistent tour schedule that's taken the band to MD, DC, PA, and all over VA, the Dudes spearheaded Central Virginia's first and only all-kids-music festival, DiggityFEST.  The festival included arts &amp; crafts, a wide variety of food vendors, roving entertainment, and 4 incredible bands, including headliner Dan Zanes &amp; Friends.  Needless to say, the success of the festival prompted immediate preparation for DiggityFEST 2, already scheduled for September 16th, 2012 (keep an eye on diggityfest.com for continual festival updates).</p><p>Also, the Dude's song My Science Project (title track off their debut record) landed at #3 on WXPN's Kids Corner (Philadelphia) Top 10 Songs of 2011, an honorable accolade given Kids Corner's vast reach and lofty position in the kids music industry.  And finally, to cap off an already wildly successful year, the Dudes welcomed their newest member, Farmer Tod Ellsworth, on bass guitar.  With a new record in the works, an ever expanding tour footprint, and preparations already underway for DiggityFEST 2, 2012 promises to be the Dudes' biggest and best year yet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-diggity-dudes/id371920302?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/diggitydudes,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/C_Sl6wArLoE"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",1947,Tony Joe White,,,http://www.tonyjoewhite.com/media/videos/,http://www.tonyjoewhite.com,6907,"<p>Tony Joe White has accomplished much in the years since he emerged from his home in Louisiana's swamp country and the hardscrabble circuit of Texas honky-tonks. His music is part of America's soundtrack - sparse and elegant, filled with shadows, sadness and beauty. Nobody else writes songs like these - songs that evoke both the mysteries of the place were he was raised and the spirits that haunt us all in our most private, lonely moments.</p><p>Nobody sings them like White either. That dark baritone, scarred and sweet, brings these songs to life like none other.  Even so, others have memorably interpreted his songs, from Brook Benton's unforgettable take on ""Rainy Night in Georgia"" in 1970 to Tina Turner's intensely soulful rendition of ""Steamy Windows.""  Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, Roy Orbison, Dusty Springfield, Etta James - iconic artists in their own right have honored ""the Swamp Fox"" by cutting his tunes.  Others have joined White, with Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Michael McDonald, Waylon Jennings, Emmylou Harris, Lucinda Williams and Shelby Lynne among those who have paid tribute as guests on recent, theme-oriented projects such as The Heroines and Uncovered.</p><p>But with The Shine, released September 28 on White's Swamp Records imprint, this long road circles and comes back toward where it began. Before exploding onto the Top 10 with ""Polk Salad Annie"" in 1969, before beginning his ongoing commitment to perform regularly for fans in markets as distant as Europe and Australia, White built his vision on a bedrock of blues, backwoods country, and sounds too much his own to categorize. This foundation is simple yet seductive and strong: Within its fabric of raw guitar, hypnotic rhythm and spellbinding lyrical imagery, White's soul pulls from its roots and reasserts itself with deep conviction.</p><p>There are no all-star cameos on The Shine - only White on guitar, harmonica and vocals, bassist George Hawkins, drummer ""Swamp Man"" Jack Bruno, Tyson Rogers on keyboards, John Catchings on cello, and a selection of songs that had sprouted in White's imagination over the previous few months. ""They just started stacking up on me and my wife Leann over the wintertime,"" White says. ""They hit me every day and every night. When I'd go to bed, they were going through my mind. It was really cool stuff, and I was like, &lsquo;Man, I've got to put these down, just to see what they sound like.'""</p><p>Each one told a different story, but taken together they seemed to call White back to the well that had first nourished him. From the feverish, dreamlike images that course through ""Season Man"" to the heartbreak that colors the romantic nostalgia of ""All,"" these tracks live on their own yet exist together as memories and premonitions of a single story.</p><p>""They're all about truth and life and daily or nightly happenings,"" White says. ""They all came to me, the guitar parts and the words, maybe at a campfire down by the river with a few cold beers. I'll sit there, strum a little bit, and all of a sudden a lick will come - except for the ones I wrote with Leann. She's a real word person, so she'll say &lsquo;what do you think about this,' and all of a sudden a little light goes off in my head, a guitar chord will pop up and here we go.""</p><p>""Paintings on a Mountain"" is one example of this collaboration between Tony Joe and Leann White. ""We have a place up in Taos, New Mexico,"" he says. ""Our house sits on land that backs up to an Indian village. It's a magic spot. In the late afternoon, the sun makes so many paintings on the mountainside; they change as the sun moves on. A lot of that was written by Leann.""</p><p>The guiding principle for The Shine can be heard in one of its details, from ""Tell Me Why,"" which preaches ""it's all about the song, keeping it simple. Got to have passion. Got to have soul."" That was the mission when White and his musicians began cutting these tracks in the living room of his home south of Nashville. Beneath high ceilings, on original hardwood floors in a building old enough to have been used as a battlefield hospital during the Civil War, they played with minimal direction, trusting in the moment as they brought these songs to life. ""Sometimes I would say &lsquo;simplify,' but that's all,"" White remembers. ""It was almost like I was a bystander. I had this weird feeling of looking at everybody as we played, watching the song happen without really trying very hard to make it happen.""</p><p>Most songs were captured in one take. The emotions and connections were so strong that even without any rehearsal, with only the barest indication of which chord followed the next, each one seemed to draw deeper from somewhere within White. He sensed this himself, sometimes not even singing where he was supposed to because the music they were laying down was so compelling. ""All of a sudden I'd remember, &lsquo;Hey, you should have been singing right there,'"" White says, chuckling. ""So I'd go back later and punch it in. But we were all very aware that something was happening in the air between us. Maybe there were some spirits walking about.""</p><p>They roamed especially free on the one track where White recorded solo, ""Roll Train Roll."" ""I think that one was a matter of being taken back,"" he reflects. ""That's what made it sound like I was going back to listening to Lightnin' Hopkins, when I lived on the Boeuf River in Goodwill, Louisiana, first learning the guitar. That's the kind of stuff I'd play out on the porch at night.""</p><p>One doesn't have to have been a Tony Joe White fan to appreciate that there is something elusive and hard to define in this music. But these depths surface in The Shine. More than a return to an artist's seminal references, this project seeks the seed from which his work took form. White finds it on The Shine; from here, all that he produced before and all that will follow come into a revealing and enduring light.</p>",http://www.tonyjoewhite.com/media/music/,,,,1945,Parachute,http://www.myspace.com/parachute,http://www.facebook.com/parachute,http://www.youtube.com/weareparachute,http://www.weareparachute.com,6887,"<p>Mixing full-throttle rock with dollops of blue-eyed soul, vintage R&amp;B and melodic pop radio anthems in-the-making, Parachute has arrived.  With routes in Charlottesville, VA, the five members of Parachute have been friends for years and have developed a sound that is all their own.  Will has been playing with drummer Johnny Stubblefield, bassist Alex Hargrave and saxophone/keyboardist Kit French since they were classmates in high school almost seven years ago. Will met Nate while attending University of Virginia together, and the guitarist joined the band three years ago.  The unmistakable energy on stage is a result of their friendship, and it has helped them to find many successes within their mixed genre.</p><p>Parachute's debut album Losing Sleep was released on Mercury Records (IDJ) in May, 2009, and has sold over 100,000 copies.  The album went to #1 on the iTunes and Amazon charts, and reached #39 on the Billboard Top200.  In conjunction with the release, their second single ""Under Control"" was released as the iTunes Free Single of the Week and went on to be one of the most downloaded releases of all times with over 600,000 downloads that week.  In winter 2009, the band released a holiday EP titled Winterlove which has sold over 16,000 units.</p><p>Although the band has found many successes in their studio release, their major achievements can be found on the road.  In 2009, Parachute played approximately 175 shows including headlining dates and support slots for band such as Switchfoot, O.A.R., Three Doors Down and Secondhand Serenade.  In November 2009, the band took off on a national tour as support for American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson's ""All I Ever Wanted"" Tour, which included dates in Canada.  The tour was so successfully, that Parachute was invited to tour with Kelly on the international leg of her tour in 2010.  Other major touring opportunities in 2010 have included a co-headlining tour with Safetysuit in January (with sold out shows in New York, Boston, Minneapolis, and St. Louis, a headlining run in the UK, and an appearance on VH1's Best Cruise Ever in April.</p><p>Since their major label debut, the band has performed live on Good Morning America (ABC), The Early Show, (CBS) and Jimmy Kimmel Live (ABC).  Additionally, they have had songs placed on The City (MTV), One Tree Hill (CW), Vampire Diaries (CW), and 90210 (CW).  Their first single, ""She Is Love"", was part of a major television campaign with Nivea Skincare, and was followed up by the company with a second campaign featuring the band's second single ""Under Control"".</p><p>This summer, the band has spent the majority of their time in Los Angeles with producer John Fields working on their new album.  They will play 18 dates in their headlining tour this fall, including shows in New York, Boston, Washington DC, Atlanta, Austin, and two private college dates.</p>",,,,,1944,Pegi Young,,,,http://www.pegiyoung.com,6946,"<p>""Foul Deeds seemed like a good album title, because this record definitely has its share of dark themes... divorce, debauchery, disillusionment and despair,"" Pegi Young says of her second album and first for Vapor Records. ""But I'm not trying to be a bummer. I'm just trying to tell some stories and make music that I can get behind.""</p><p>Foul Deeds, which Young co-produced, overflows with the same richly evocative songcraft that made her self-titled 2007 debut a revelation. That album exposed the late-blooming artist as both an affecting singer and a songwriter of rare eloquence and insight. The new disc finds Young continuing to make music of uncommon warmth and gravity, delivering her lyrics of heartbreak and hard-won wisdom in understated, quietly powerful musical settings whose hushed, haunted beauty underlines the material's emotional immediacy.</p><p>""I don't write happy songs, and the songs I'm attracted to tend to be kind of melancholy,"" Young observes. ""I don't really know why that is, but that's just how they come to me, and I have to let 'em come on through.""</p><p>Pegi initially came to the public's attention through her longstanding role as backup singer with Neil Young, her husband of three decades. But Foul Deeds -- whose first 5000 copies will also include the bonus live DVD Love Like Water, directed by noted filmmaker Jonathan Demme at the Tower Theatre in Philadelphia -- makes it clear that Pegi's iconoclastic creative voice is very much her own. Her uncanny knack for cutting to the heart of thorny emotional issues drives such indelible originals as ""Broken Vows,"" ""Starting Over,"" ""Who Knew"" and the rueful title track. Another highlight is the dusky, lilting ""Traveling,"" which appears on the album in two versions, one spare and dreamy, and the other performed with a full band.</p><p>In addition to Young's own compositions, Foul Deeds features the artist's personalized interpretations of a quartet of songs by other writers. Her compelling readings of Will Jennings' ""Pleasing to Me,"" Lucinda Williams' ""Side of the Road,"" Devendra Banhart's ""Body Breaks"" and B. Boatman's ""Blue Sunday"" imbue those already-distinctive songs with additional depth and color.</p><p>""I'm still a big believer in the old idea of a record being a complete experience,"" Young asserts. ""So it matters to me that the songs have thematic relevance, and that somehow it tells some kind of story. Maybe people don't really listen to records as a whole anymore, and you can work on the sequencing till the cows come home but they'll still put it on shuffle and it doesn't matter. But it matters to me, and this group of songs just seem to make sense together.""</p><p>Foul Deeds reteams Young with the group of veteran musicians and longtime friends whose sensitivity and rapport helped to distinguish her debut effort. Multi-instrumentalist Ben Keith (who co-produced the album with Young), guitarist/harmony singer Anthony Crawford and bassist Rick Rosas, who comprised Young's live band while touring behind her debut, were joined on the sessions by drummer Phil Jones, whose resume includes work with Tom Petty and Bob Dylan. Elsewhere on Foul Deeds, Neil Young plays guitar on three tracks, which also feature legendary keyboardist Spooner Oldham and noted session drummer Karl Himmel.</p><p>Pegi Young began writing songs and playing guitar while still in high school, but eventually put her creative instincts on hold to attend to the demands of family life. Pegi and Neil's experiences caring for their son Ben, who was born with cerebral palsy, led Pegi to co-found the non-profit Bridge School, whose innovative methods of aiding children with severe speech and physical impairments have established the school as a leader in its field over the past 25 years. Pegi and Neil have also been the forces behind the annual all-star Bridge School Benefit concerts, and Pegi continues to serve as president of the school's Board of Directors.</p><p>Pegi found herself drawn towards music again after she began touring as backup singer with her husband's band beginning in 2000. With her kids grown and the confidence gained from performing numerous live shows, she finally had the time and focus to begin recording her own songs.</p><p>""When I was younger, I was way, way too shy to do anything but very amateur performing,"" Young states. ""But it eventually became a matter of having these opportunities and building some confidence and thinking, do I really want to be on my deathbed going 'Damn, I wish I'd made some records'? So I did it, and I loved it. And then I had more songs, so I did it again.""</p><p>Having gained further experience from making her first album and touring extensively to support it, she took a more hands-on role in Foul Deeds' recording process.</p><p>""I did end up taking more of a leadership role this time,"" Young notes. ""The whole project felt a lot less tentative and more focused, just because I'd done it already. It all came together very quickly. We'd been on the road so much that we were all pretty in sync, and adding Phil on drums had really opened things up, so I just thought, we had to get some of this on tape. We pulled it together very spontaneously, and recorded for three or four days, and everything kind of came together.""</p><p>With a pair of personally charged, deeply felt albums under her belt, Pegi Young is embracing music-making with passion and pragmatism.</p><p>""I'm 57, so I'm never gonna be the next big thing, but I'm cool with that,"" she concludes. ""If I was younger, I might be more focused on the commerce part of it. But I'm not a 20-year-old trying to make a living, so I don't have to conform to some record company's idea of whatever they're looking for that week. In that way, I guess I can be truly independent and focus on the creative part. I have no idea where it will go from here, but I'm having fun and I feel really, really good about what I've done so far.""</p>",,,,,1942,Nathan Angelo + Todd Carey,http://www.myspace.com/nathanangelo,,,http://www.nathanangelo.com/,6719,"<p>Although a newcomer to the southeast music scene, Atlanta-based Nathan Angelo has been immersed in music for over a decade. The son of a practicing minister, Nathan was surrounded by a family of musicians who nudged him to learn piano at age six. Four years later, Nathan began leading his father's congregation in music and was later appointed the volunteer Director of Music, a title which he held until he left for college. This experience proved significant in shaping his career path and honed his talent as a performer.</p><p>Through Playing Me is Nathan's freshman effort, a collection of 13 songs that are both wistful and contemplative all at once. The debut is a candid account of his life experiences -- an outlet to ""escape reality and guide it as well"" that eschews any airs of pretentiousness. Propelled by remarkable melodies and the groove-tinged rhythm section, an homage to Nathan's early influences of Motown artists such as Jackson 5 and Ray Charles, Through Playing Me evolves as a refreshing and accomplished debut from a very promising new artist.  It's that promise that prompted Edendust to write: ""His voice, his lyricism, his musicianship ... a talent this enormous shouldn't have to do anything but write, record and perform. He's just got so much to give ... so much to say"".</p><p>Through Playing Me is scheduled for a July 2006 release. His listeners will be nothing short of moved. Each and every track brings yet another sincere expression of human vulnerability and strength.

Benefit Concert to Support Youth Suicide Prevention feat. Berret & Harrison,http://www.myspace.com/berrettandharrison,,,,6704,"<p>Drawing inspiration from screwing up (a lot), Taylor Berrett has been writing and performing songs for five years. His music can best be described as blues-influenced acoustic folk-pop that floats from sarcasm to sincerity, but he will also take ""good"" or ""bad"" as acceptable descriptions, based on individual opinion. In addition to songwriting, Taylor actively pursues guitar playing. His recently-obsessive study of jazz and blues instrumentation occasionally hops over into his songwriting before it is shooed back into its corner. Taylor has shared the stage with groups that include Switchfoot, REO Speedwagon, Derek James, and Shane Hines and the Trance. He loves ping-pong and hates speaking in the third person. I hope you enjoy my music.</p><p>Matthew enjoys what he does. And if he doesn't enjoy what he is doing, he doesn't do it. But he enjoys lots of things so that's usually not a problem. One of the things he greatly enjoys is music, music of all sorts, music that makes him want to dance, think, be happy, sad, delectable, undeniable, maniacal, really smiley. He expresses his own music through various percussion instruments (including the drum set, which he started playing around... let's say 6 years ago?? 2003? The international year of freshwater? European disability year?), the piano, and any melodic musical instrument, electric or acoustic, that has keys on it. He and Taylor have started to become obsessed with foosball. The favorite game used to be ping-pong but now it is foosball. It is no longer ping-pong. Just thought I would let you know that.

Since the mid 1960s generation after generation have been held spellbound by his extraordinary ground-breaking acoustic guitar playing and classic emotive songs. Jimmy Page, Neil Young, Nick Drake, Johnny Marr, Bernard Butler and Beth Orton have all been devotees, and further generations, led by Devendra Banhart and Pete Doherty, are still discovering Jansch for themselves.<br /> <br />Bert began performing his unique synthesis of folk, blues and jazz in the early 1960s, having hitch-hiked to London from his hometown of Edinburgh. His iconic first album, Bert Jansch (April 1965), was played on borrowed guitars and recorded on a reel-to-reel tape deck. Bert Jansch caused a sensation for its innovative guitar technique and powerful songs, and has been phenomenally influential to this day, cited by legions of guitar players (famous and otherwise) as a major inspiration. It was followed by It Don't Bother Me (December 1965) and the also hugely influential Jack Orion (September 1966), where Bert began exploring innovative treatments of traditional folk, something he took further with Pentangle, the acoustic supergroup he formed in 1967 with John Renbourn, Jacqui McShee, Danny Thompson and Terry Cox.<br /> <br />After Pentangle split in 1973, Bert returned to his prolific solo career. His 21st solo album, Crimson Moon, appeared in 2000 accompanied by a Channel 4 documentary, Dreamweaver, and Bloomsbury's publication of a major biography: Dazzling Stranger: Bert Jansch and the British Folk and Blues Revival by Colin Harper (new expanded edition August 2006 with foreword by Johnny Marr). In 2001 Bert was awarded a BBC Radio 2 Lifetime Achievement Award at the Radio 2 Folk Awards. Edge of a Dream (featuring Bernard Butler, Hope Sandoval, Dave Swarbrick and Ralph McTell) was released in October 2002 to widespread critical acclaim across Europe. In November 2003 Bert celebrated his 60th birthday with a BBC TV Special shown on BBC4, and a sell-out birthday concert with guests at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall.<br /> <br />In 2006 Bert worked with some of the latest musicians to emerge on the scene on his highly acclaimed most recent album, The Black Swan , including producer Noah Georgeson (Devendra Banhart - Cripple Crow , Joanna Newsom - Milk-Eyed Mender ); and musicians and vocalists Beth Orton, Devendra Banhart, Otto Hauser (Espers, Vetiver), Helena Espvall (Espers) and Kevin Barker (Currituck Co). The Black Swan was hailed internationally as one of Bert's greatest albums - MOJO called it an ""instant classic"" and gave it five stars (something hardly ever seen), while in the US it was ""better than Dylan"".<br /> <br />On 5 June 2006 Bert received the MOJO Merit Award from MOJO magazine at the MOJO Honours List ceremony. The award was ""based around an expanded career that still continues to be inspirational"" and was presented by Beth Orton and Roy Harper. Bert was also involved in the major BBC TV series Folk Britannia, and featured in Will Hodgkinson's acclaimed books: Guitar Man and Song Man. In November 2007 Bert received an honorary Doctorate of Music from Napier University in Edinburgh.<br /> <br />A lavish Pentangle box set, The Time Has Come, featuring much previously unheard material, appeared in March 2007 to extensive commercial and critical acclaim, and Pentangle received a Lifetime Achievement Award of their own at the 2007 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, where they performed two songs - the first time the original band had played together in 35 years. A full UK tour for Pentangle followed in 2008 - a truly triumphant reunion, hailed by press and public alike.<br /> <br />Bert's own classic solo back catalogue has also been digitally remastered and is now available beautifully re-packaged, featuring all the original artwork plus new sleevenotes and photographs and many extra bonus tracks. This culminated in 2009 with the long awaited first-time CD release of Bert's three Charisma albums: the seminal L.A. Turnaround, Santa Barbara Honeymoon and A Rare Conundrum. The re-mastering of these most sought-after albums in Bert's catalogue was supervised by Bert himself, and as well as unreleased bonus tracks, the new CD of L.A. Turnaround includes a previously unseen 13 minute film made during the recording of the album. Each of these new editions is gorgeously packaged using the original artwork along with contemporary photos and memorabilia as well as specially written notes.</p><p>More than 40 years since the start of his distinguished career, passion and demand for Bert's work has never been higher. Today Bert is still as active, innovative and influential as ever, and in a live setting his performances are still a rare opportunity to see one of the British music scene's true legends play. His understated, low key approach treats the audience to a guitar playing master class, and an impressive catalogue of some of the most haunting songs in the British canon.</p>",,,,,1933,The Pimps of Joytime,http://www.myspace.com/pimpsofjoytime,http://www.facebook.com/pimpsofjoytime,,,6691,"<p>If you have yet to encounter the Broklyn-based band, The Pimps of Joytime, prepare to take a funky ride! The PJT's live events and recordings have captivated fans all across the country, as they have begun writing their own success story, show by show, and track by track.</p><p>Bandleader Brian J is a charismatic and soulful visionary, whose well-crafted songs invite the listener to enter a world of infectious dance grooves and indelible melodies. Spending formative years in New York City, New Orleans and Los Angeles, Mista J honed his craft, becoming an accomplished live performer, multi-instrumentalist and producer.</p><p>In 2005, Brian began to assemble a group of righteously soulful vocalists and musicians to assist in bringing to life the musical concept that would become The Pimps of Joytime. The band's diverse sound and spirited attitude is strongly influenced by the Brooklyn DJ culture and live music scene from which they emerge. Recent collaborations with legendary artists Cyril and Art Neville of the Neville Brothers and Roy Ayers have helped vitalize the band's connection to its roots.</p><p>Over the course of the past four years, The Pimps have evolved into a road tested and audience approved groove machine. They have excited crowds at over 100 club dates and festivals in 2009 alone, and are on target to exceed that volume in 2010. The exponential growth of the band's fan base can be partially attributed to an artful blend of musical styles, including elements of afrobeat, salsa, rock &amp; roll and electronica. Brian J's classic songwriting and the band's undeniable swagger on stage consistently energizes dance parties wherever they appear.</p><p>In 2008, with their first studio album and a remix album released through the boutique label Wonderwheel Recordings, The Pimps of Joytime were prepared to take their career to the highest level.

The self-titled effort is her first album of new material since 2009's Stupid Love and her first as an independent artist. Returning to the sound of her first two albums, ""...her music has a reflective surface that can make it difficult to look inside"" (Nashville Scene), Mindy Smith further showcases her timeless sound and music.</p><p>Of ""Closer,"" Mindy says, ""Many times in life's journey, we find ourselves disoriented. For me, I make destructive decisions that can distract me from my ultimate goal. I think I am making the right choices and staying close to my agenda but I just run off course. In ""Closer,"" I see the North Star as the prize. One that I am always getting so close to but unable to grab a hold of and then it eludes me. Personally this song paints a picture of how I see my musical career and that I see NOW is my moment. Taking the time to listen for the answers to my questions. I guess NOW is always our moment even if it is only etching out one little piece of the bigger picture.""</p><p>Co-produced with Jason Lehning, the collection features 11 original compositions-seven of which Smith wrote with the remaining four as co-writes. Recorded at Sound Emporium Studio in Nashville, the album features some of Nashville best players, including Bryan Sutton (guitar); Lex Price (bass); Ian Fitchuk (drums); and Joe Pisapia (guitar), Jason Lehning (guitar), and Dan Dugmore (pedal steel). Prior to the release of her 2004 debut, the New York native charmed fans with her rendition of Dolly Parton's ""Jolene,"" for the much-praised Dolly Parton tribute album, Just Because I'm a Woman. Her Vanguard Records debut album, One Moment More, went on to earn numerous critical accolades, featured the hit single ""Come to Jesus,"" and sold over 300,000 copies. She subsequently released Long Island Shores (Vanguard, 2006), My Holiday (Vanguard, 2007), and Stupid Love (Vanguard, 2009).</p><p>In August 2011, Mindy and longtime friend Daniel Tashian recorded ""Taking You With Me,"" a duet featured in the film and soundtrack for Paul Rudd's film Our Idiot Brother.

I am a singer, songwriter, performer and musician from Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. No, that's not near Philadelphia. Nope, it's nowhere near Pittsburgh either. Sorry.</p><p>On January 1st, 2009 I made a New Year's resolution to record and release a CD of some of the songs I had written over the years for my two daughters. A few months later Thank You for Joining The Happy Club came out and the world has literally never been the same. Think about it: before that there was no Thank You for Joining The Happy Club in the world and after that there was. See how much the world has changed? (At left is my first sketch for the cover of Happy Club.)</p><p>Much to my delight, Happy Club was quickly well received by kid's music bloggers, kid's music radio stations and, most importantly, by kids! Since then I've been making a go of this Kindie Rock business. (Kindie = 'kids + indie' for all you newbies.) (A newbie is someone who just arrived on the scene.) (Not a scene like in a movie, but a scene as in something happening that, aw forget it.) My song People Really Like Milk went to #1 on the SIRIUS/XM satellite radio kids music channel Kids Place Live, and scored a glowing review on the National Public Radio program All Things Considered. The review was literally glowing. It was an eerie sight to behold.</p><p>Since then I've been busy making videos for kids, writing more songs for kids, and playing shows for kids with my band Billy Kelly and The Blahblahblahs. My friends Bob, Jake, Gary and Evan make up the Blahblahblahs part of the band and I, for the most part, am Billy Kelly. n August of 2010 I released my follow-up to Happy Club, a 10-song CD called Is This Some Kind of Joke? The new CD featured a duet with Davy Jones from The Monkees on my song Me and My Brand New Haircut, plus nine other songs. (Do the math.) The CD comes with a big colorful poster and a maze, both printed on this cool waterproof paper called YUPO. You can do the maze with a washable magic marker (included!) and then clean it off with a damp sponge. You can even take it in the bathtub with you, if that's the sort of thing you like to do.</p><p>The Family Garden came out in April of this year (2011)(AD). It's got a whole bunch of new songs on it - some that I wrote, some that other folks wrote and one that I wrote with my friend Molly Ledford, from the great kids music band Lunch Money. Me and The Blahblahblahs will be playing concerts all over the country this Spring, Summer and Fall.&nbsp; When I'm not making music I enjoy spending time with my family, walking around Lewisburg, writing poems, drawing pictures, and working in my garden. I also enjoy finishing writing my bio.

He also had the privilege of performing an original song (""Hope for Our Children"") at the Embassy of the Republic of Guyana in March of 2009. Most recently, Kevin went on a musical mission trip of sorts in New Zealand, where he spoke and performed his original music for multitudes of all ages.</p><p>In trying to infuse all of his music with a joyful sincerity, Kevin finds resounding truth in the words of the late Pope John Paul II:</p><p>""Those who perceive in themselves this kind of divine spark which is the artistic vocation - as poet, writer, sculptor, architect, musician, actor and so on - feel at the same time the obligation not to waste this talent but to develop it, in order to put it at the service of their neighbor and of humanity as a whole.""</p>",,,,,1859,Ben Carroll,http://www.myspace.com/bencarrollmusic,,http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ben+carroll&search_type=,http://www.bencarroll.com,6427,"<p>Ben Carroll's soulful, powerful voice lives somewhere at the crossroads of Stevie Wonder and James Taylor's captivating, distinctive, mesmerizing. With the help of his accomplished acoustic guitar playing, he moves his audiences with his plaintive songwriting, written from the heart and with a thoughtful, sometimes keen eye, while exploring the endless themes of love, of a search for a place and meaning in the world. A soul and folk artist at once, Carroll has steadily toured North America and Europe as a solo act since 2004. He released his debut solo album Lover Undercover in 2005 and his followup Real Thing in 2007 (on UK label Blue Cloud Records), which was #1 for five weeks on AAA FM Radio in Ohio and was played on over fifty radio stations in the US and Europe. His songs have also been featured in television and film, most recently in Pier's End Productions 2008 release Wake""��_, which premiered at the Tribeca Cinema in New York City (home of the Tribeca Film Festival). Amore Magazine's reader poll voted Carroll a top solo artist, and his songwriting and performances have been celebrated by the New York Songwriters Circle and BMI New York.</p><p>Coming from a musical family as the son of Grammy-winning Starland Vocal Band members (""Afternoon Delight"", 1976), Carroll enjoyed a rich musical exposure in his childhood, chiefly in the veins of harmony-laden folk and pop of the 70s, and the R&amp;B/Soul/Roots sounds of the deep south. These influences have been naturally integrated into his music, lustrously evoked by his poetic delivery and his voice of startling honesty and beauty.</p>",,,,,1854,Ellen Winter,,,,,0,,,,,,1848,Knife At A Gunfight,http://www.myspace.com/knifeatagunfightband,,,,0,,,,,,1846,Berrett and Harrison,http://www.myspace.com/berrettandharrison,,,,6388,"<p>Drawing inspiration from screwing up (a lot), Taylor Berrett has been writing and performing songs for five years. His music can best be described as blues-influenced acoustic folk-pop that floats from sarcasm to sincerity, but he will also take ""good"" or ""bad"" as acceptable descriptions, based on individual opinion. In addition to songwriting, Taylor actively pursues guitar playing. His recently-obsessive study of jazz and blues instrumentation occasionally hops over into his songwriting before it is shooed back into its corner. Taylor has shared the stage with groups that include Switchfoot, REO Speedwagon, Derek James, and Shane Hines and the Trance. He loves ping-pong and hates speaking in the third person. I hope you enjoy my music.</p><p>Matthew enjoys what he does. And if he doesn't enjoy what he is doing, he doesn't do it. But he enjoys lots of things so that's usually not a problem. One of the things he greatly enjoys is music, music of all sorts, music that makes him want to dance, think, be happy, sad, delectable, undeniable, maniacal, really smiley. He expresses his own music through various percussion instruments (including the drum set, which he started playing around... let's say 6 years ago?? 2003? The international year of freshwater? European disability year?), the piano, and any melodic musical instrument, electric or acoustic, that has keys on it. He and Taylor have started to become obsessed with foosball. The favorite game used to be ping-pong but now it is foosball. It is no longer ping-pong. Just thought I would let you know that. Matthew says: ""I hope you enjoy listening.""</p>",,,,,1842,Lights Over Paris,http://www.myspace.com/LightsOverParis,http://www.facebook.com/lightsoverparis,http://lightsoverparis.com/video,http://lightsoverparis.com,6353,"<p>Reflective of the love of beautiful views, heights, planes and travel for which they are named, LIGHTS OVER PARIS' mentality and musical refection is indicative of the phrase ""sky's the limit"". The lyrical content, stage show and party atmosphere are a direct representation of the music that flows through the blood of each member.</p><p>As a teenager in 2005, Will Pepper did a web search for ""singers"" for his band ""The Voice"" to compete in a battle of the bands. Singer Robb Mawhinney aka TaLLLLL responded to the search and what would eventually be Lights Over Paris, began to take shape. After competing in battle of the bands, the two of them took all their savings, rented out a cheap studio and cut eight songs. They posted these songs on their MySpace page. Soon they captured the attention of songwriter and producer Matt Salazar. ""The Voice"" broke up but Salazar came in and cut four new songs and brought in another addition, DJ Shiny to help Will and TaLLLLL shape the sound of the band now known as Lights Over Paris.</p><p>Lights Over Paris operates with a group mentality. Front man TaLLLLL writes the lyrics and melodies summoning his own life experiences as well as his active imagination. Will Pepper rocks out on a custom Keytar, providing the keyboard based tracks that are evident throughout Lights Over Paris' music. Pepper has been a noted classical piano player since the age of five. Lead Guitarist Devin Bronson is the seasoned veteran of Lights Over Paris as he has not only toured with multi-platinum acts like Avril Lavigne but also helmed the music director reigns-the same position he holds with Lights Over Paris. Dave Gentry has been playing drums since 12 years old, touring since his teens and kicks ass on the Pork Pie Lights Over Paris kit. Rounding out the band is Mike Torres who was handpicked for his mind blowing bass playing (playing upside down) and leadership, Mike has been touring worldwide for acts such as Ashley Tisdale.</p><p>Lights Over Paris dropped their first EP, Turn Off The Lights EP on April 13, 2010 on Type One Records/Digital Records. With musical influences ranging from AC/DC and Oingo Boingo, Kanye West and Lady Gaga to Blink 182 and Green Day, Lights Over Paris is not limited to one particular genre. ""The EP is really designed to have very unique tracks that suit various types of moods the audience could be feeling on any given day. I wanted to make an album where all the songs didn't sound the same"", says TaLLLLL, ""My influences were all over the place.""</p><p>Although the music comes first, the social interactions come in a close second. Lights Over Paris is the marriage of music and the show Entourage. The parties are not just a way to blow off steam as much as they are a way to bringing fans to that next level of being a part of your favorite band. ""People should expect a lot of movement and random events happening throughout the show"" states TaLLLLL ""A little after party to get to know the fans, always something eventful. Fans are most important to us."" Lights Over Paris have been known to create events just so that fans can get involved and get the most out of there Lights Over Paris experience.</p><p>The first single, a radio SMASH called ""Turn Off The Lights"", produced by Kevin Rudolf (""Let It Rock"") is heating up the airwaves. The band is now preparing for its first nationwide tour to kick off on the West Coast this FALL! The guys always have a plan lined up before and after the show, so regardless of anything else, people who come to a Lights Over Paris show can count on having an INSANE night!</p>",,,,,1839,Son of a Bad Man,http://www.myspace.com/sonofabadmanmusic,,,,6349,"<p>""When I started to write my own songs, I tried to just take in everything I heard and learn from it,"" says frontman Shawn Fisher. ""It wasn't until a few years later that I really began to figure out my own way of saying things."" And these days, judging by the rabid reactions of the crowds that buy Shawn's music and pack the shows by him and his band Son of a Bad Man, the 21-year-old singer-songwriter's way of saying things is one that a lot of people are crazy about.</p><p>And perhaps the best testimony thus far to Son of a Bad Man's jaw-dropping gifts as both composers and as performers is This is Me, their astonishing Universal Republic debut. Full of enough huge, sweeping choruses to fill every stadium in America, and rich with soaring vocals that absolutely beg to be blasted out of rolled-down, summer-cruising car windows, the five-song EP was cut in a head-spinning five days with Grammy-winning producer John Fields (Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus, Pink, Switchfoot). The result? A disc that utterly explodes with dangerously addictive, radio-ready anthems like ""Open Your Eyes,"" an uplifting, redemptive plea to a lost and lonely girl; ""Out of Control,"" a sexy, hip-churning party track about a love moving way too fast; and the defiant, guitar-crunching, fist-in-the-air title track. With This is Me, Son of a Bad Man hit the airwaves like a fully formed, heat-seeking rock 'n' roll comet.</p><p>""Shawn is that rare breed of singer that makes you believe every word he says, just by his opening up the throttle and letting loose,"" says Semisonic's Dan Wilson, who collaborated with Son of a Bad Man on the album, along with Chris Henderson (3 Doors Down), Mike Viola (That Thing You Do and Walk Hard soundtracks), Chris DeStefano (Carly Smithson), and the Norwegian duo Espionage (Beyonc&eacute;, Train, Chris Brown).</p><p>The son of a classic rock-fan dad and a country-loving mom, Shawn started in his teens as a solo acoustic artist, working the clubs and coffeehouses of his native Jacksonville, Florida. Although he sometimes performed with his brother Cody on drums and others, it eventually came time to kick things up a few notches, and Shawn decided to put together a band that matched his increasingly wide-screen pop ambitions. Cherry picking from the cream of the local rock scene, he assembled Son of a Bad Man-guitarists Casey King and Robbie Vanosdol, bassist Scraggle, and drummer Brad Moxey-who quickly became one of Jacksonville's top-drawing acts, appearing with Bryan Adams, Foreigner, Gavin DeGraw, Hinder, the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, and others. In 2008 the band recorded a self-titled independent EP that went on to sell a formidable 5,000 copies.</p><p>It's at shows, however, that Son of a Bad Man is truly in their element, thanks to constant touring. ""We get as many compliments on our intense live show as we do on our music itself,"" says Shawn. ""We really bring all of our energy to the stage."" The band is quick to return the good vibes to its admirers, keeping in touch with its rapidly burgeoning fan base by spending as much eight hours a day on its Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace sites.</p><p>""Every challenge is fun, and we work our asses off to prove ourselves,"" Shawn says. ""We want people to get a sense of honesty from our music, and to relate it to their own lives. And we want them to have a really good time when they hear it.""</p><p>Modest goals, perhaps, yet ones that take even older artists years to attain. Goals that Son of a Bad Man, however, hit with an ease that truly belies their youth. The future looks bright indeed.</p>",,,,,1834,Bell X1,,http://www.facebook.com/bellx1,http://www.youtube.com/bellx1,http://main.bellx1.com/,17662,"<p>Bell X1 are a band from Dublin,  Ireland known for their wide range of styles, powerful live performances, intelligent and witty lyrics, and dedication to touring.

Think raw emotion, sonic tension and effects, effects, effects. Meld this with lush, haunting vocals and impressionistic lyrics.  See a show or listen to one of their songs loud with headphones and you will see why fans claim that Koshari's music is almost visual in nature.</p><p>To Koshari music is a way to evoke emotion and spur thought. They are heartfelt about their art, no pretenses. Using odd time signatures, dynamics, layer upon layer of melody and driving rhythms they create music meant for those open minded souls that are looking to be moved both musically and mentally.</p><p>The enveloping volume at their live shows and their will to purposely mix all instruments, including vocals, at near-equal volume allows for creative interplay within frequencies and will pull you in and make you listen again and again. Their songs have been best described as, ""pin-wheeling imagery with a layered and languorous sound.""</p><p>When recording, the band pushes for an intertwining of raw performance and quality sound - not subscribing to the popular use of overdubs. Koshari released their 3rd recording, Reappear, in June 2009, and will be playing area and regional gigs to support the release.</p><p>They have shared the stage with a variety of different bands ranging from Sleepytime Gorilla Museum to Adam Franklin of Swervedriver.</p><p>If you like My Bloody Valentine, A Perfect Circle, Autolux, Swervedriver, Death Cab for Cutie, or if you are just looking for something moving and new, you will be taken with Koshari.</p>",,,,,1826,Eric Brace & Peter Cooper (Full Sets!),,,,,0,,,,,,1825,Acoustic In-The-Round with Eric Brace,,,,http://redbeetrecords.com/index.htm?id=15630&sid=15618&inc=7&album_id=1358,6307,"<p>Since 1997, Eric Brace has been the frontman and songwriter for the acclaimed roots-rock band Last Train Home. With eight CDs and one live concert DVD to its credit, LTH is one of the most prolific and admired bands in the ""Americana"" world. <br /> <br />At the core of the band's sound are Eric's evocative songs and his warm voice. ""Brace's tenor, when combined with his lyrics which evoke endless late nights on the prairies without ever specifically referring to them, is one of the treasures of the whole Americana genre,"" says roots-rock great Sid Griffin (Long Ryders, Coal Porters) in a review in the peerless British music magazine MOJO. <br />The Washington Post proclaims that ""Brace hasn't let years of grueling road work compromise his songcraft,"" while the British audiophile magazine Hi-Fi Plus lauds Eric's ""great grasp of melody and song structure.""</p><p>With his latest release, ""You Don't Have to Like Them Both,"" Eric steps away from the comfortable surroundings of Last Train Home, and puts his own name on the cover of the CD. It's a co-bill, a duo recording with Nashville songwriter Peter Cooper (whose debut ""Mission Door"" is a Red Beet release). Eric and Peter have been friends since Eric's move to Nashville in 2004, a friendship that was solidified in Peter's living room listening to Tom T. Hall, Willis Alan Ramsey, the Seldom Scene, Charley Pride while pouring screw top red wine. Pretty soon they were playing guitars and singing songs together-first in that same living room, then on tour: Europe, Alaska, and the Lower 48 too. Then came the recording sessions for ""You Don't Have to Like Them Both,"" where some of the greatest musicians in Nashville lent their skills to songs of Eric's and Peter's, as well as covers by Jim Lauderdale, Todd Snider, Kris Kristofferson and others.</p><p>The collaboration with Peter Cooper is the second of Eric's non-LTH projects, the first being the 2006 release ""The Skylighters."" That's Eric, plus bluegrass legends Mike Auldridge (dobro, pedal steel) and Jimmy Gaudreau (mandolin, guitar), along with the LTH rhythm section of Jim Gray and Martin Lynds. That record is a lively mix of bluegrass, country, western swing and more.</p><p>Besides keeping LTH rolling down the track, Eric's got several other collaborations and solo projects in the works. One currently on the front burner is a musical (or song cycle or concept album or whatever you want to call it) about the California Gold Rush. It's a collaboration with Washington DC songwriter Karl Straub (whose songs ""Tonight,"" ""It Doesn't Matter,"" ""They Dance Real Close There,"" and ""Soul Parking"" have been recorded by LTH).</p><p>This whole musical path started when Eric played in a Boston-area bluegrass band, the Mystic Valley Mountaneers, while in college. Back in Washington DC in the '80s he formed the guitar-pop/indie-rock band B-Time with his brother Alan Brace.<br />A more roots oriented band, the Beggars, followed in the early '90s, again with Alan, LTH steel player Dave Van Allen, singer Alice Despard, ex-Neighbor guitarist John Moremen, and others. Eric also spent several years playing bass with Kevin Johnson &amp; the Linemen. During that same period, Eric ran the Washington-area label Top Records, releasing a dozen albums by DC bands Carnival of Souls, the New Keys, Sleep of Reason, Not Even, and more.</p><p>From 1992 to 2002, Eric was a columnist for The Washington Post, covering first the local arts scene, then the area's nightlife and live music world.</p><p>In 1997, the self-titled ""Last Train Home"" CD was released, and it was just a matter of time before word got out to the point where Eric could take LTH on the road full-time. That happened in 2002, the same year that LTH won the Washington Area Music Association's Wammie award for ""Artist of the Year."" Since then, the band has appeared on the CBS's ""Late, Late Show with Craig Ferguson,"" the syndicated public radio program ""Mountain Stage,"" and on stage opening for the likes of Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton.</p><p>Living in Nashville has led to recognition of Eric's strengths as a songwriter, and he has collaborated with some of Nashville's finest writers, such as Jim Lauderdale, Walter Egan, Amelia White. He recently formed the Red Beet Records label, releasing two compilation CDs of music from East Nashville, as well as Peter Cooper's ""Mission Door"" and Fayssoux's ""Early.""</p>",,,,,1823,The

""The Beginning"" quickly gathered critical acclaim from press and fans alike. The band received praise from AbsolutePunk and was named in the Absolute 100 bands you need to know.  Journey's shoes decided to pick up the bands video ""Like a Million Lights"" and feature the video in all Journeys stores nationwide. Other retailers quickly caught the buzz of This Love and Hot Topic placed their EP ""The Beginning"" in stores nationwide. This Love had a huge 2010, from being featured on the front page of Substream Magazine, and being a regularly featured band on Purevolume, to being featured on Fearless Radio, Dj Rosstar, The Gunz Show, and much more. The band also found time to play shows with bands such as Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Let's Get It, Cute is What We Aim For, The Bigger Lights, Friday Night Boys, House of Heroes, and played Journey's Backyard BBQ.</p><p>2011 is expected to be an even bigger year for This Love, as they plan the release of their sophomore album, ""At War"". This is a full concept album on the conflict between love and hate; man vs himself This Love is based simply around living with passion. Reviving rock 'n' roll so that listeners can relate to the music and lyrics, and in doing so find inspiration to love and live the way they truly want. So with that, what is your love? Get out there and be a light.

Over the years they moved in and out of bands together, gaining experience and working hard to build a solid and supportive fanbase. Their latest project, The Goodnight Anthem, put them in front of thousands of fans through touring, radio airplay, and usage on MTV's The Real World. When they found bassist Rob Clancy, the lineup gelled and it became apparent that it was the perfect time to launch their new project. With a new lineup, new EP, and new name - New County is poised and ready to break into the mainstream.</p><p>The debut EP - LIVES WE LEAD - contains five energetic and well-crafted songs that clearly showcase New County's earnest style of writing. As Rodini explains ""My goal when writing is to be as honest as possible.  I'm not afraid to share what I want to say or what I'm going through, but at the same time want listeners to be able to relate to the songs. The band wants to reach a wide spectrum of fans, not just the younger kids who really seek out new music, but also an older demographic who will stumble upon us and find that they enjoy the music.""</p><p>The writing and recording process for the EP also introduced the band to something new - the desert. The band went to Phoenix, AZ to work with producer Matt Grabe (The Maine, A Rocket To The Moon), which greatly influenced the final sound. As Flack explains ""Being in such new territory inspired us to try things that we have never tried before while writing. It was a fresh start, no one really knew us, but at the same time we had an opportunity to meet so many new people. It was an amazing and life-changing experience.""</p><p>LIVES WE LEAD shows a wide variety of music styles held together by a consistent quality and sound. The almost country-sounding &lsquo;I'm No Him' was actually pulled from an older release and given a whole new life by Matt Grabe. Flack recalls ""Matt heard it and had this almost mad scientist moment, totally envisioning the new version for our EP. We couldn't be happier with how it turned out - it's one of our favorites on the new record."" The song discusses the wish to be liked for who you are and not being compared to others, and is one of the band's most honest.</p><p>On the opposite side of the spectrum is the upbeat and poppy, yet slightly dark song &lsquo;Over It."" Sam Means from The Format came in to help out with this song, which introduced the band to yet another new experience: co-writing. Flack elaborates ""Tony and I had a Format song on pretty much every party playlist we've ever put together, so it was an amazing experience to get to work with someone we had respected for so long. Sam is one of the nicest guys you could meet, and he is really great at writing hooks. We never would have attempted a chorus like the one in ""Over It"" unless Sam had pushed us, and it really brought us into new territory as songwriters.""</p><p>New County is currently looking forward to releasing LIVES WE LEAD, then getting out on the road and continuing to discover new and exciting experiences.</p>",,,,,1814,National Wildlife Federation Fundraiser w/ Sematic,http://www.myspace.com/sematic,,,http://www.sematicmusic.com,6278,,,,,,1812,Sparks To Inferno,,,,,0,,,,,,1811,Land Of The Giants,http://www.myspace.com/landofthegiantsmusic,http://www.facebook.com/LandoftheGiants,,,6267,"<p>Formed in March 2010, Land of the Giants is a Washington, DC based band that brings a fresh alternative sound with meaningful lyrics and pop-punk undertones.

However you understand the lyrics, in whichever way you construe the melodies, whatever emotions rise within you, whether it generates nostalgia or pain or hope or something you can't name, Blue Sky Noise expands to encompass any possible perception of itself.</p><p>The Doylestown, PA-based band's multi-faceted sound has always allowed infinite space for interpretation, melding intricate prog and mind-bending psychedelia with massive riffs and singer Anthony Green's reflective, intimate lyricism. With Blue Sky Noise, Circa Survive have crystallized their complex sound and equally involved ideas about the world around them into their most confident and focused collection to date. Songs like ""Imaginary Enemy"" and ""Get Out"" are elaborately orchestrated and intensely powerful, offering the purest expression thus far of Circa Survive's singular identity.</p><p>Hailed as a remarkably visceral live act since their 2004 foundation, Circa Survive followed 2007's acclaimed second album, On Letting Go, with nearly two years of non-stop touring, roadwork which saw the band bridging a diverse range of audiences with its idiosyncratic sonic vision. In addition to treks alongside bands such as Coheed &amp; Cambria, Thrice, Pelican, and My Chemical Romance, Circa Survive dropped jaws at such dissimilar music festivals as Vans Warped Tour and Coachella.</p><p>Upon returning home to the house they shared in Doylestown, the band took a brief but much-needed pause in order to readjust and revive their energies. It wasn't long before the five musicians began allowing ideas to gestate for a new record. In October of 2008, the band acquired a cottage-like house that bordered a stream and a nature preserve. They called it ""The Creek House"" and in one of its rooms, with a large picture window looking out into the world, they wrote nearly every day for several months. The process had its ups and down. The band, then unsigned, struggled with a tumultuous internal pressure to create something they were proud of, something that elevated their music to a new level of skill and innovation.</p><p>Green, in particular, was consumed with uncertainty and felt unable to live up to his own expectations. Mid-way through the writing process, the singer had a breakdown, going what he calls ""mentally bankrupt and ruined with self-doubt."" With the band's support, he checked himself into a mental institution, where he spent a period of time recovering his sense of balance and unearthing a new perspective.</p><p>""I just wanted to get better,"" Green explains. ""People should know that when they get to their wit's end they should get help. I went to the local crisis center. I had to do that in order to make this record.""</p><p>When Green returned, although some of the problems remained, he found himself better able to confront the challenge of crafting this record with his bandmates. Circa Survive returned to writing every day in The Creek House. They eschewed any formula for songwriting. Every musical idea had its own method of creation, its own unique path of maturing into songs. For the first time in Circa Survive, guitarist Colin Frangicetto contributed lyrics and melodies for two songs-""I Felt Free"" and ""Imaginary Enemy""-and the band worked collaboratively to build a unified record piece by piece, song by song. ""Frozen Creek,"" a haunting track written by Green and guitarist Brendan Ekstrom (the two also collaborated on ""Get Out""), marked the first time the musicians felt they were on the right track during the writing process, and from there the group constructed the songs into an integrated whole, book-ended by surging opener ""Strange Terrain"" and shyly hopeful closer ""Dyed In the Wool.""</p><p>""We really wanted to make sure we were writing a cohesive full-length album,"" says Ekstrom. ""We wanted people to listen to our record from front to back, with all the songs flowing together seamlessly. A lot of it is a reflection of our personalities and what we went through, but also a reflection of the state of music and our reaction to the disintegration of the album.""</p><p>In the spring of 2009, the band, now signed with Atlantic Records, made a list of possible producers. They met with several, all dream scenarios, and immediately felt a connection with David Bottrill (Muse, Tool, King Crimson). The band sent songs to Bottrill from The Creek House throughout the spring and by the time they arrived in Toronto in July to begin preproduction, that communication had grown into a supportive discourse that helped the songs grow into the best versions of themselves. Circa Survive spent three and a half months in Toronto, recording in several different spaces, always reminding each other of the common goal they were working toward: making the best album possible.</p><p>""We wanted to make a record with an element of patience,"" Frangicetto explains. ""One where you might not discover something until the third or even thirtieth listen. David was the perfect guy for that. He was very intent on preserving the artist's vision. He wanted to take what we did and make it better. It was the most peaceful recording session we've ever had. He kept us in a team mentality. He told us on our last day, &lsquo;I don't think you guys could have made a better record.'""</p><p>The twelve songs on Blue Sky Noise swell and dissolve into each other. The fervor and desperate force of ""Get Out"" as Green howls ""Locked myself up in a room without a window/ Just to see if it was any easier to breathe"" find equal strength in his bandmates' impassioned instrumentals. The urgent liberation of ""I Felt Free"" is reflected in its propulsive guitars, soaring melodies and the throb of an underlying beat. Layers of sound, built with revving guitars, patterned rhythms and the ardor of Green's vocals, allow the record to intensify and suspend, sprawling into vast atmospheric spaces and surging together into dramatic climaxes. Every track stands alone, but each stands taller beside its companions. It offers a profound sense of catharsis and represents a collective healing process for the musicians who birthed it. It is a segment of a greater whole, another stride toward an ultimate realization.</p><p>""I feel like it says a million things,"" Green says. ""It's all in the album. And it's all in the other albums. It's a bunch of unsaid stuff that I haven't recorded yet. Every album is a chapter and a step toward the truth. And you're never going to get there, you just have to keep going and going. I want this record to be in the world. It only makes sense out there. I'm like a pregnant mother about to explode. I just want it out there. It's weighing me down and I love it so much and I just want it to be alive so I can put it to my teat.""</p>",http://www.circasurvive.com/album/blue-sky-noise/,,,,1795,Nick Howard + Rachel P,,,,,0,,,,,,1788,Atomic Tom,http://www.myspace.com/atomictom,http://www.facebook.com/atomictomband,http://www.youtube.com/user/weareatomictom ,http://atomictom.com/ ,11677,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Late show!

A captivated subway car watched as they expertly played the song using only their smartphone apps with White singing his heart out from his seat.</p><p>Being prescient 21st century rockers, they filmed everything and uploaded it to YouTube immediately. The clip became a viral phenomenon, exceeding 5 million views and making ""Take Me Out"" a bona fide hit. However, that's only a snapshot of the band's journey thus far.Their Universal Republic Records debut, The Moment, dropped in stores on November 22nd 2010, and Atomic Tom began to make waves across pop culture beyond the digital realm. They performed ""Take Me Out"" on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Lopez Tonight, The CBS Early Show, and Rachael Ray, while also appearing on The Today Show, E! News, and Fuse TV's A Different Spin with Mark Hoppus.</p><p>The band also toured tirelessly across North America, their on-stage prowess converting curious concertgoers into die-hard fans. ""Take Me Out"" holds a special place in their hearts though. Atomic Tom has only begun making ""magic"" though. White concludes, ""We've got something very special together, and it's been amazing to share that with the world. I can't wait to see where this train takes us next.""</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are some records that manage to span multiple eras of time and various places, in essence creating a new sonic space. New Englanders Bronze Radio Return have done just that on their sophomore album, the gorgeous and varied SHAKE! SHAKE! SHAKE!. For debut Old Time Speaker, the band relocated to Nashville for a two-week period, to, as Henderson puts it ""a place we'd never been with a producer we'd never met, and played a bunch of songs we'd never played before."" For such an inauspicious set of circumstances, the band managed a solid and well-received debut, and forged a lasting bond with producer Chad Copelin. Old Time Speaker established the band's relentless touring schedule, including an invitation to represent the Connecticut music scene by performing for President Obama at an event in Bridgeport, CT in 2010. Fan favorites ""Digital Love"" and ""Lo-Fi"" have been picked up for advertising and television licensing and the album landed on CMJ's Top 200 Album Chart.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Bronze Radio Return&nbsp; </span><a href=""http://www.bronzeradioreturn.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/bronzeradio"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/bronzeradioreturn"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Bronze-Radio-Return/25326931728"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fbronze-radio-return%252Fid276554600%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/bronzeradioreturn"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""><br /><br /></span></p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/atomic-tom/id81565843?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/#!/atomictom,,1784,LIGHTS - special acoustic performance,http://www.myspace.com/lights,http://www.iamlights.com/,http://www.youtube.com/lights,http://www.iamlights.com/,6151,"<p>Most twenty-two year old pop stars have an army of professional image sculptors behind them: producers, songwriters, stylists, and abused assistants. But LIGHTS, who grew up all over the world, is used to traveling light. So she decided she'd simplify things by doing all those jobs herself. ""It's easy to misconstrue a young girl singer as a total puppet. I am the opposite of that. This is what I do. I am LIGHTS.""</p><p>Born in Timmins, Ontario, LIGHTS lived in the Philippines and Jamaica during her elementary school years. ""My family is very get-up-and-go if we feel called to do something different,"" the singer explains. ""It was a really important thing to learn about as a kid, that nothing is so important that you cant leave it behind."" LIGHTS' mother home schooled the kids; but, one day a week the singer's father would take over. ""We looked forward to that day because we got to recite poetry and learn music. Nothing was taken too seriously and we got to sing. That really instilled in me a passion for music.""</p><p>In 1997 the family moved back to Canada and almost immediately, nine year-old LIGHTS got her hands on a guitar. By eleven she'd learned a handful of chords, which she used to write her first song. Then, at thirteen she turned her attention to production. ""I had so many more ideas than just the vocals and the guitar. I wanted to put a glockenspiel and strings and a bass and drums in there!""</p><p>As a teenager Lights spent much of her time writing songs up in her attic bedroom, which she dubbed Starry Night studios after her favorite Van Gogh painting. By eighteen LIGHTS had moved out of her parents' house and was living in Toronto with only her pet tarantula Lance to keep her company. In this state of near-isolation LIGHTS finally found her signature sound- a merging of classic pop songwriting with deeply intimate yet universally appealing lyrics. She wrote ""February Air,"" a poignant ode to the chill of winter love, which became the first of four LIGHTS songs used by Old Navy in the company's 2008 spring ad campaign.</p><p>Though her star was clearly on the rise, it was LIGHTS' online profile that really solidified her fan base. Between the singer's MySpace page (which to date has over eight million visits and fifteen million plays,) her personal web site iamlights.com and her passion for web-based fantasy games like World of Warcraft, the artist's online identity is as evolved as your nerdiest teenage boy's and this is something she's very proud of. ""There's an entire world of people out there that play WoW and are talking about science fiction and they feel a little bit outcast, so if you can reach those people that's sweet! Even my look is inspired by video game characters - it's a cross between Laura Croft and Wonder Woman.""</p><p>In April 2008 LIGHTS released her eponymous EP. It contained six songs including ""February Air,"" which reached #3 on the MuchMusic countdown in Canada, as well as the epic ""Drive My Soul,"" which was an even bigger hit; the song was added to radio without being serviced, climbed all the way to #1 on Much Music, and spent over three months in the Top 20 on Hot AC radio. On the strength of her EP alone, LIGHTS won the 2009 Juno (the Canadian equivalent of a Grammy Award) for New Artist of the Year, joining the ranks of Feist and Nelly Furtado.</p><p>The singer's rapidly growing fan base was clamoring for live LIGHTS shows so she hit the road, playing countless sold out gigs in her home country, as well as numerous festival dates in the UK. In addition to touring extensively through the United States, this summer LIGHTS spent five weeks on the 2009 Vans Warped Tour and this fall will join Keane on their Canadian tour.</p><p>LIGHTS' full-length debut, The Listening, is out now. It includes a few songs already familiar to die-hard Lights fans, as well as plenty of new material including the first single, ""Saviour,"" a propulsive pop ballad that represents the essence of Lights. ""My songs are spawned from moments of sadness or intense emotion,"" the singer says. ""'Saviour' is a big example of taking one of those really dark emotional situations and turning it into something positive. I just happened to get hit with a really dark sad night. The melody started coming together and the words started pouring out. I was crying when I wrote the first line of the chorus and it actually sounds kind of like crying. It's a really, really powerful song for me.""</p><p>Using music to translate something painful into something transcendent is LIGHTS' primary purpose. It's her commitment to keeping pure the connection that music creates that guides her as she prepares to release her first major album. ""I think about how some of the greatest artists over time kind of went crazy because they didn't have that ability to show people who they were,"" the singer muses. ""They were living a double life and that's not healthy. Now you can be yourself and people will still love you for it. Who you see is exactly who I am. And I think if I maintain that and don't fake anything with my fans, I'll never go crazy.""</p>",,,,,1779,OTC Funk,http://www.myspace.com/otcfunk,,,,6123,"<p>What do you get when you combine a Berklee trained guitarist, an Oberlin graduate keyboardist, a well rounded bassist/producer and a drummer who's too funky for his own good?

Songs are massive combining  heavy guitars, shot-gun drums, extraordinary bass lines, endless  harmonies, and unforgettable hooks. Influences are varied (Stones, JET,  Foo, Queen, QOTSA, Zeppelin, Beatles) but not overt or overdone as each  song is performed via the musical talents of four very different rock  and roll souls - from a Berklee trained bass player and trumpet-trained  lead guitar player, to a self-taught country picker and a drummer from a  marching band. This rare mix of rock'n'rolla's produces powerful tracks  that give listeners' multiple influences in every song. The band's  first studio album, Stay Gold Sessions (available @ iTunes and CD Baby),  was a stripped down, self-produced affair recorded live in early 2007  in an attempt to capture the band's raw energy and pop hooks. Stay Gold  Sessions was followed up by multiple live performances including the  2008 and 2009 Shamrock Festivals in Washington DC (DC area's biggest St.  Patrick's Day Festival). After more live performances in the summer of  2009, the boys put touring on hold to record their second album.

The band started out in early 2005 when founding members Kurt Snyder (drums), Jude Plessas (bass) and Jason Hoese (lead guitar) first started laying down the instrumentation. The configuration of the band was set in March of 2007 when Bill Hughes joined to take on vocal duties, adding rhythm guitar to boot. From the Police to the Smiths, Queens of The Stone Age to Tool, Cheap Trick to Clutch, their influences are extremely wide ranging, letting each member bring something unique to the table to help shape their sound. Whether it's a straight-up rocker with groove, something melodic and soft, or whacked out indulgence, Fight The Bear does it a unique way with style and energy.

On Hug Trees Tom brings his jazzy and rootsy vibe over to the kids' music side for the first time.</p><p>""I've been writing and making music for a long time. Becoming a father just added a beautiful new layer to the whole experience for me,"" says Freund. ""On Hug Trees, my daughter Delilah is my co-producer, my audience, my muse. We created these songs together over the last couple of years. It was very natural to just go ahead and make a record.""</p><p>The music bar was kept high on the new set as the younger generation was only part of the focus. ""I've come to know full well that whatever my daughter is listening to or watching, my wife Francie and I are going to get a steady diet of. I tried to keep that in mind when making Hug Trees, to live up to both standards. I wanted it to be fun for kids and yet remain sonically pleasing to parents on the 40th listen in the car.""</p><p>The theme of Hug Trees is for kids to get outside and enjoy nature with a nod to Freund's new home Venice Beach. Whether gathering sea shells, walking the dog or hugging a tree, Freund urges kids to get outside and keep it moving. To help spread the word, the NY-raised singer rounded together a bevy of great musicians and produced the project with Steve McCormick at his studio in Mar Vista, California. The album features instruments ranging from ukulele and mandolin to stand up bass and slide guitar. Michael Jerome (Richard Thompson) and Richie Hayward (Little Feet) share drum duties, Eric Heywood (Ray Lamontagne) plays pedal steel and even a member of Canned Heat, Stanley ""the Baron"" Behrens plays saxophone. Guest singers on Hug Trees include the ever-amazing Victoria Williams who adds her beautiful voice and childlike playfulness to ""Seashells"". Rising star Brett Dennen pulls double duty by penning and singing on the rowdy ""Party in the Yard"". The lovely and talented Abra Moore brightens up ""Apple From The Tree.""</p><p>""I hope people enjoy the album as much as we enjoyed making it,"" says Freund.

Produced by Bonham, the album was mixed by Tchad Blake (Tom Waits, Los Lobos, Lisa Germano) and features the Brooklyn-based Smokey's Roundup, a trio led by guitarist Smokey Hormel (Tom Waits, Beck, Norah Jones), as the backing band.</p><p>Masts Of Manhatta is deeply rooted in the places where Bonham resides and recorded the album - Brooklyn and Woodstock, NY. It reflects two circular journeys: one leading Bonham away from music only to return to it, renewed, and a second - her trek from city to country and back, creating a loop as she responds to the inexorable pull of the two disparate ways of life.</p><p>""The City versus Country theme threads through the record,"" says Bonham. ""This is our life at the moment: the balance of nature and the big city. Longing to be surrounded by nature, to get back to a quiet and balanced life, but needing to be in the city as working people/artists.""</p><p>""We Moved Our City to the Country"" tackles this dichotomy outright. ""We find ourselves wanting to get away from the city, getting closer to nature, but unable to really walk the walk and finding most people doing the same: still attached to comforts - and our American suburban conveniences like Home Depot, Target, cell phones and wireless Internet,"" she observes.</p><p>Yet Masts Of Manhatta suggests it is possible to retain a purity of spirit even amidst the trappings of urban life. The title is a nod to ""Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,"" a poem by Walt Whitman.</p><p>""As Whitman is describing the waters, the birds, the people on the ferry, he looks back at the tall buildings of lower Manhattan and writes: &lsquo;Stand up, tall masts of Manhatta!' as if the buildings are masts of a ship,"" says Bonham. ""He's having a moment of wonder and I love that. At that moment he sounds perfectly present, in the moment, loving being alive and connected to everything, everyone.""</p><p>For Bonham, that sense of connection emerged in the years following the 2005 release of Blink the Brightest, as she fell in love, married and sought to lead a simpler life. To do so might require a career change, she initially thought. A devout student of yoga, she obtained her teaching certification last summer in Woodstock. Spending time in ""a little bluestone cottage"" there, reading Whitman and Emerson aloud with her husband, she came to realize that she could take her music back to the basics as well. She began writing just for herself - raw, honest songs. In time, friends joined in and Masts Of Manhatta was born.</p><p>While it came about in an organic fashion, Masts Of Manhatta is not exactly a collection of bucolic songs. Bonham's trademark wit and wordplay are at work whether evoking the dirt we sweep under the carpet or the kind that gets under your fingernails. She attempts to be her own best friend in ""Reciprocal Feelings"" - but is at first rebuffed. The sizzling ""Devil's Got Your Boyfriend"" is every bit as seductive as the temptress the narrator warns of. ""When You Laugh"" is an exquisite paean to a love ""like June and Johnny,"" but ecstasy cuts and burns on the percolating ""Big Red Heart."" The gently rollicking ""In The Moonlight"" recalls a mother-daughter road trip that, years later, reveals an eternal truth.</p><p>""Mom's favorite saying was &lsquo;to thine own self be true,' a quote from Hamlet,"" Tracy remembers. ""I would always roll my eyes as a teen. I never paid attention to those words until much later in life. ""</p><p>In ""Josephine,"" innocence evaporates when a carnie carries away a young girl. And while the infectious ""Angel, Won't You Come Down?"" wouldn't sound out of place at a barn dance, elsewhere Bonham's violin brings traces of classical, klezmer, blues, tango and more, all coalescing into a sound that's uniquely her own. Fans can check out some of the new tracks at http://www.tracybonham.com/.</p><p>Prior to the release of Masts Of Manhatta, Bonham will play several shows in New York. On April 28th, she'll perform at Galapagos Art Space in DUMBO Brooklyn and she'll continue her residency at Cornelia Street Caf&eacute; with a show on May 5th that will feature special guest Rhett Miller (Old 97's). Bonham will play Soundout for Scholarships, a concert benefit for Woodstock Day School featuring Deborah Harry, Chris Stein and Matt Katz-Bohen of Blondie plus several special guests, at the Bearsville Theater on May 28th. She'll also appear at the Beacon RiverFest 2010, a free concert that will take place in Beacon, NY on June 26th.</p><p>A native of Eugene, Oregon, Bonham began singing at age five, playing the violin at nine and piano at age 14. After attending the University of Southern California in violin performance and studying jazz vocals at Berklee College of Music, she started her own band and began writing songs. Her 1996 major label debut, The Burdens of Being Upright (Island) with the hit single ""Mother Mother"" was certified Gold and led to a pair of GRAMMY&reg; nominations (Best Female Vocalist and Best Alternative Rock Performance). Down Here followed in 2000 and Blink the Brightest was released in 2005 to widespread critical acclaim. ""Bonham sings with a maturity and clarity reminiscent of songwriters like Joni Mitchell and Shawn Colvin, backing her words with self-executed guitar, keyboards, piano and violin,"" said Amplified. Rolling Stone praised its ""tuneful alt-rock"" while Entertainment Weekly said, ""Bonham was built to last.""</p><p>She's toured extensively and has appeared on numerous television shows, including ""The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,"" ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"" and ""Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson,"" among others. Tracy has also released two EPs and appeared as guest vocalist/violinist with artists such as Blue Man Group, Juliana Hatfield, Ron Sexsmith, Aerosmith, Wayfaring Strangers, Latin Playboys, NoBlues from the Netherlands, Soulwax from Belgium, Mark Oliver Everett of The Eels, and Jimmy Page and Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin.</p>",http://www.engineroomrecordings.com/tracy-bonham-stream/,,,,1764,Mark Olson (founding member of The Jayhawks) CD Release,http://www.myspace.com/markolsonmusic,,,,6196,"<p>The sun-soaked political reggae of Bob Marley certainly isn't the most obvious parallel to make when discussing the music of folk troubadour Mark Olson, but while discussing the song ""Kingsnake"" from his upcoming solo album, Many Colored Kite, Olson makes a compelling argument:</p><p>""I really like Bob Marley's lyrical attitude-the way he forcefully delivers his lyrics means everything to him. When I first heard him, I must have been nineteen or something; it was all very mysterious to me, and I didn't get it then. But as time's gone by, I realize that he's very direct. He has a point of view and a philosophy, and though my point of view and my philosophy are different, I try to be direct like that.""</p><p>This philosophical directness has been a constant in a career that's spanned a quarter century. As a founding member and principal singer/songwriter of The Jayhawks, Olson spent a decade at the front of the alt-country movement, until leaving the band-and the familiar environs of Minneapolis-in 1995, for the California desert.</p><p>While The Jayhawks were experimenting with pop and rock influences and earning mainstream appeal, Olson wanted to strip back down to the essentials. He formed The Creekdippers with then-wife Victoria Williams and violinist Mike Russell, paring his brand of timeless folk down to a desert roots ramble.</p><p>After a decade with The Creekdippers, Olson left the desert for the train cars of Europe, creating what would become his 2007 solo debut, The Salvation Blues, a poetic rumination on redemption that earned him comparisons to the likes of Gram Parsons and Bob Dylan.</p><p>During that journey, he reconnected with former Jayhawks partner Gary Louris and in 2009 they released their first album together in fourteen years, Ready For The Flood.</p><p>Many Colored Kite is both a culmination of everything that came before it, and an exploration of uncharted waters. Recorded over a month's time in Portland with producer/engineer Beau Raymond (Chris Robinson, Devendra Banhart), the album finds Olson embracing a decidedly brighter path towards the future, exploring themes of freedom and struggle, isolation and belonging, spirituality and love.</p><p>He translates that idea of Bob Marley's lyrical directness into a beautiful simplicity of expression, creating ""little moral stories,"" as he calls them. Album opener ""Little Bird Of Freedom,"" which features folk-jazz chanteuse Jolie Holland, is an acknowledgement of both personal and universal struggle, which the title track, written at a park in Oslo, Norway, takes a step further. ""To me, a &lsquo;many colored kite' is the idea that instead of having a restrictive world, let's have an inclusive one, where it's good for people to have different ideas, different faiths, different languages.""</p><p>Olson also turns inward. There's ""Your Life Beside Us,"" about ""a spiritual longing for good in one's life,"" and the lush, string-laden ""Beehive,"" calling upon his love of metaphor to describe the evolution of religion into a destructive, rather than healing force. Most surprising is ""Morning Dove,"" a ""miracle song"" inspired by a flock of doves that appeared right as he finished building his home. It marks the first time in his entire career that Olson performs completely solo and acoustic. ""I've always been in bands or groups; I've always liked playing off of other people,"" he says. ""But this song seemed so direct and personal, that I just went for it.""</p><p>A message of positivity weaves through Many Colored Kite, offering up a nearly radiant version of Olson that not only hearkens back to his Creekdippers days, but also looks forward to the future of folk. There's the sweetly melodic ""No Time To Live Without Her,"" inspired by the simple love songs of the &lsquo;60s, featuring ethereal harmonies from influential British folksinger Vashti Bunyan. ""Bluebell Song,"" inspired by flowers dotted along miles of Texas highway, recounts the experience of sharing those slices of Americana with his two international bandmates, Norwegian singer and multi-instrumentalist Ingunn Ringvold and Italian violinist Michele Gazich.</p><p>The experience of being on the road with people close to him is what ultimately shapes the narrative of the album.  In this case, thousands of miles spent in vans, trains, and planes for The Salvation Blues led to the creation of Many Colored Kite. ""It was more than a band-Ingunn was my girlfriend and Michele was this guy whose company I really enjoyed-and the way to keep that going was to write a new album together.""</p><p>So you have the Laurel Canyon vibe of ""Wind And Rain,"" borne from a lonely drive through rural Nebraska and the urge to pull over and stage an impromptu performance on a small-town bandstand. There's ""More Hours,"" a sweet retelling of a conversation between Olson and Ringvold on a desert road. And the freak folk echoes of ""Scholastica,"" about meeting a nun of the same name in New Mexico.</p><p>Ultimately, Many Colored Kite is a statement album. It's Mark Olson acknowledging the past, but making a conscious decision to lift up and continue his journey forward. ""Let's face it-I worked hard on this record. I put everything I had into this one. I tried to play my best, sing my best, and write my best. I want this to look towards the future, and I hope our story goes on.""</p>",,,,,1762,Maria Muldaur and Her Red Hot Bluesianna Band,,,http://www.mariamuldaur.com/video.html,http://www.mariamuldaur.com,6272,"<p>Best known for her seductive '70s pop staple ""Midnight at the Oasis,"" Maria Muldaur has since become an acclaimed interpreter of just about every stripe of American roots music: blues, early jazz, gospel, folk, country, R&amp;B, and so on. While these influences were certainly present on her more pop-oriented '70s recordings (as befitting her Greenwich Village folkie past), Muldaur truly came into her own as a true roots music stylist during the '90s, when she developed a particular fascination with the myriad sounds of Louisiana. On the string of well-received albums that followed, Muldaur tied her eclecticism together with the romantic sensuality that had underpinned much of her best work ever since the beginning of her career.</p>",http://www.mariamuldaur.com/listen.html,,,,1759,Chuck Prophet,http://www.myspace.com/chuckprophetofficial,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Chuck-Prophet-Official/10029785422,http://chuckprophet.com/video/,http://chuckprophet.com,11676,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Early show!

He has written with a wide rage of artists from Dan Penn to Alejandro Escovedo (the 2008 LP, Real Animal), laid down tracks on sessions for everyone from Warren Zevon to Kelly Willis and taken the stage with Jim Dickinson, Lucinda Williams and Aimee Mann, to name a few. Prophet's production credits include Willis' Translated From Love (2007) and working on Jace Everett's (""Bad Things"" / True Blood) new release Red Revelations. He's heard his own tunes performed by legends like Solomon Burke and Heart and his songs have charted on both country (""I'm Gone,"" a co-write with Kim Richey, on the debut album of country starlet Cyndi Thompson) and AAA radio (""Summertime Thing,"" from 2002's No Other Love, was a lazy radio anthem).</p><p>National television appearances include Austin City Limits in support of No Other Love, as well as Letterman and Carson Daly, supporting 2007's Soap &amp; Water. His music has increasingly been featured in film and television, most recently as the closing track to episode two of True Blood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/chuck-prophet/id6058892?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/ChuckProphet/,,1758,Rocknoceros: American Cancer Society Springtime Benefit Show,,,http://vimeo.com/4064606,http://www.rocknoceros.com/,8644,"<p><strong><a href=""http://www.zooglobble.com/"" target=""_blank"">Zooglobble Recommended!</a>: ""Kudos to the great taste of the DC area. You already know what the rest of the country is starting to find out - that Rocknoceros is a gem of a band.""</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As every family with youngsters in the DC area already knows, Rocknoceros (pronounced like rhinoceros) is three guys: Coach Cotton, Williebob, and Boogie Woogie Bennie. After seeing them perform, there is no denying that they are not a typical trio. Coach Cotton is the ring-leader, frequently immersed in a sea of knee-high concert goers. Wearing a wireless head-set microphone, he wades through the mass of dancing children, dispersing high-fives and shaking a tambourine. Williebob provides the necessary string work for the show, moving among a collection of guitars, mandolins, and banjos while wearing a kazoo around his neck. Boogie Woogie Bennie is a one-man-band within the power trio, employing a contraption that one four-year-old fan described as ""the piano-drum"". The piano-drum allows Boogie Bennie to play the bass drum with his right foot, the snare drum and hi-hat cymbal with his left foot, and the keyboard with his hands (with his left hand playing the bass parts). Together, Rocknoceros is able to cover a dizzying range of musical styles in each set. From Tin Pan Alley to the shores of Jamaica, Rocknoceros hops from genre to genre like a toad on summer asphalt.</p>",,,,,1756,Jammin Java 10th Anniversary Bash: Deep River + Brindley Brothers Reunion,http://www.myspace.com/deeprivermusicva,http://www.facebook.com/deeprivermusic,http://www.youtube.com/user/deeprivermusic,http://deeprivermusic.com/,11659,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span><em></em></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""></span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""><br /></span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""></span>On this day, 10 years ago Jammin Java first opened its doors.

And though We've All Been There, Band's solo debut (released June 29 on his own AMB label through EMI), contains the first new material we've heard from the former leader of The Calling in half a decade, ""Wherever You Will Go"" (which he wrote at 16 and released at 19, remarkably enough) remains a staple of the Adult Pop format, while ""Our Lives"" is a heavily used bumper on ESPN and other sports programming.</p><p>If his fans feel that Band is long overdue for a return to the spotlight, the L.A. native has himself been chafing at the bit to make his return throughout the last five years, which he spent in musical exile. But the time has finally come for that voice to inspire us once again. ""I've lived with these songs for years,"" says Band, ""and the whole point is to share them with everybody now.""</p><p>The torrid first single, ""Tonight,"" is now in rotation at Adult Pop radio, where Band remained a core artist during his years of silence. The track was placed in the TV campaign for this summer's World Cup (just as ""Our Lives"" was played over the closing ceremonies of the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics). The striking video, directed by TV veteran David Barrett (CSI: NY, NCIS: Los Angeles), features Band doing his own stunts, including jumping-or more accurately flying-off the top of a cliff. Check it out on YouTube.</p><p>At its heart, though, We've All Been There charts the course of a distinctly human romantic relationship, from its first stirrings to its final moments. ""A lot of these songs are drawn from personal experiences,"" Band confirms. ""I got married at the beginning of this process and got divorced at the end of the record. &lsquo;Love' was written in the early stages of that relationship, when my ex-wife was going through medical problems, which we dealt with throughout the years. And &lsquo;Leave (Today Is the Day)' was the last song I added to the record, after we'd gotten divorced. So a bunch of these songs are extremely personal.""</p><p>His then-wife's illness led to the critical need for a liver transplant, which she had to forgo due to the waiting list. The experience inspired Band to devote his time and energies to the Donate Life organization, which is dedicated to building organ-donor awareness.</p><p>Band's creative mechanism was also triggered by ""what I've seen friends and family going through, and I've been hugely influenced by what's happening in the world. And music, of course-I don't think anyone can listen to my records and not realize I'm a huge fan of U2. I get massive inspiration from going to shows by some of my favorite bands like U2 and Coldplay. But the biggest inspiration for this record was what I went through-the frustration of it all and trying to stay positive. But it resulted in some good songs, at least.""</p><p>So where's he been all this time? ""After the second album,"" Band recalls, ""my partner in The Calling, Aaron Kamin, wanted to do other things, and since I was already pretty much doing everything on my own, I decided to become a solo artist."" But when the powers that be at RCA insisted that he do a ""supergroup"" album project, Band sought and got his release, signing with Geffen soon thereafter.</p><p>Thus began an elongated project that would span nearly two years, eventually encompassing no less than five co-producers, primarily including the veteran John Fields (Switchfoot), up-and-comer Daniel Damico and engineer Tal Herzberg, with Chuck Reed helming two tracks and Matt Serletic one. Playing alongside Band, who plays guitars and several of the basslines, were some of the best musicians on the planet, including drummers Abe Laboriel Jr., Dorian Crozier and Kenny Aronoff, keyboard player Jamie Muhoberac and guitarist Tim Pierce. The renowned Paul Buckmaster (Elton John's '70s classics) contributed string arrangements to several tracks, while the in-demand Chris Lord-Alge mixed the album, as he'd done with The Calling. Loaded with potential hits-and strikingly cohesive despite its diverse origins-the album was completed in 2007.</p><p>This summer, Alex took the record to the road, and has been playing live shows with his band.

Her well-deserved reputation as one of our very best singer/songwriters has followed her through nine critically-acclaimed recordings. With her tenth and newest project, Hello Stranger, released in August 2009, she gifts her loyal fan base and entices new listeners with a recording that captures some of the magic of her live performances.  With the help of her Nashville-based record label, Compass Records, she selected a few of Nashville's best musicians to make an album featuring fiddle, mandolin and banjo as well as acoustic guitar.</p><p>Catie Curtis and her producer, Garry West, put a fresh spin on some of Curtis's best-loved songs as well as several handpicked classics. The supporting musicians, Alison Brown and Stuart Duncan, along with Gary Marinelli (acoustic guitars, mandolin and resophonic guitar), Kenny Malone (drums and percussion) and Todd Phillips (acoustic bass) deliver these tunes with a pop, sizzle and shine. But most of all, the music is fun to listen to again and again. Country meets Catie in style!</p><p>Curtis has created a dedicated following that has grown steadily over the course of her 15-year career.  With her live shows, film and tv placements, the 2006 International Songwriting Competition Grand Prize, and now the Hello Stranger string-band project, Curtis has proven that she's the real deal: a musician with the kind of raw talent and artistic maturity that makes her a force to be reckoned with, albeit a sweet force.</p>",,,,,1747,The Sweetback Sisters,http://www.myspace.com/thesweetbacksisters,http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Sweetback-Sisters/56513051702,,http://WWW.THESWEETBACKSISTERS.COM/,6021,"<p>Like their pseudo-sister role models, the Davis Sisters, the Sweetback Sisters sing country songs in close, surrogate-sister harmony and matching dresses.

my favorite duet. It's exquisite.""-Taylor Swift on ""Poison &amp; Wine"" via iTunes playlist</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,1730,Citizen*,,,,,0,,,,,,1723,TVTV,http://www.myspace.com/tvtv,http://www.facebook.com/tvtvrock,http://www.youtube.com/user/TvTvRock,,5968,,,,,,1722,2AM Club,http://www.myspace.com/2amclub,http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=101623813210893,http://www.2amclubmusic.com/media,http://www.2amclubmusic.com/,5935,"<p>2AM Club know how to throw a party-and it's not one you're going to forget the next day. Funk, pop, rock, blue-eyed soul, hip-hop, new wave, and electro all converge to create a genre-bending sound that's completely unique, instantly relatable, and practically begging to be danced to. These six 20-something guys-singer Marc Griffin, emcee Tyler Cordy, guitarist Matt Reagan, keyboard player Dave Dalton, drummer Ian O'Neill and bassist Matt Warshauer, AKA ""Sauce""-bring a diverse array of influences to the table (Jay Z to the Beatles, Duran Duran to the Beastie Boys, Stevie Wonder to The Strokes), effortlessly synthesizing the very best of all that has come before them to create music that is resoundingly modern.<br />One part Seattle, one part Bay Area and one part Northeast, the group came together in Los Angeles in 2007 and honed their skills playing the local college scene before heading up and down the West Coast, booking, producing, and headlining their own gigs. After recording some demos with Jerry Harrison-a former member of the Talking Heads and Modern Lovers-2AM Club played a now-legendary four-month residency they called ""Tiny Porno"" at the Derby in L.A., and word quickly spread that it was the place to be: ""We wanted to create an environment that wasn't like the typical L.A. promotional circuit,"" says Sauce. ""We wanted something raw, sweaty, dark, and disgusting. It turned into a huge thing.""</p><p>2AM Club's shows never fail to explode with energy, heightened by the hyperactive musical tango between Tyler and Marc's vocals, and the way that the band-named for a beloved Bay Area bar known for being a welcoming chill spot for a random assortment of locals-honor their moniker by making their shows an all-inclusive, unpretentious good time for all who attend.</p><p>""Our idea has always been to try to break down the fourth wall,"" says Tyler. ""A lot of bands play for the audience while the audience just stands there. We wanted a different dynamic. Everybody's in the room and we're all listening to music, we should be experiencing it together. The Tiny Porno shows were crucial because they exploded with that kind of crazy energy.""</p><p>With a buzz like that, it was only a matter of time before the labels came knocking, and 2AM Club signed with RCA Records in September 2008. Since then, they've relocated to NYC, where they've been sequestered in the studio with seasoned producers Sam Hollander and Dave Katz (Boys Like Girls, Katy Perry, Gym Class Heroes), recording tracks for their debut album. With live crowd-pleasers such as ""Flashing Room"" (a thumping, ode to sex that's a bit more than casual, featuring soaring 80s-esque synths, sly rock riffs, and a sky-high chorus), ""Hurricane"" (a seductive slow jam that unspools into panoramic pop), and ""Let Me Down Easy"" (which sounds like what might happen if Eminem body-slammed New Edition) already in the bag, expect rip-roaring rock riffs, punchy new wave-inflected synths, ass-shaking hip-hop beats, clever wordplay (exhibit a: ""she left her cares on the bedpost, next to her lipstick and her Mentos""), and a dash of good old Motown-style soul. In other words, expect a record full of unique and entirely creative cuts that span a vast musical landscape.</p><p>While there may be touches of everyone from Prince to Maroon 5 to Justin Timberlake to D'Angelo in their DNA, the interplay between Marc's smooth singing voice and Tyler's effortless staccato flow makes 2AM Club sound completely fresh. They also lay strong emphasis on solid songwriting (an effort that involves the whole band), giving them a lyrical and melodic sophistication that's rarely seen in groups so young. 2AM Club's songs may be predominantly about sex and girls, nights out and lights out, but they're also inventive, intelligent, and shot through with real sentiment because they're written about things that are actually happening in the band member's lives.</p><p>""Pop music has been made for so long, a lot of it has obviously become clich&eacute; and hackneyed,"" says Tyler. ""We're hoping that if we can make it a little bit smarter, we can take it somewhere new and cool and exciting. It comes down to a bigger idea of love and conflict and greatness and bullshit. I think most people can identify with that, but then on another level it's also just super dumb drunk party music-you can take from it what you will.""</p><p>""I think we've all always wanted to be saying something with music,"" adds Marc. ""That's why we started out in poetry slams and doing hip-hop. We may be making music that's more pop now, which has this overarching feeling of being catchy and melodic and cheeky, but we're hoping you can listen to it 20 times and still be taking something new away from it on a deeper level.""</p><p>""In other words,"" says Matt, ""we're hoping the album will be something you can play at a party, but that you'll also want to play after the party when you get home.""</p>",,,,,1717,RFC 93 Boys Soccer Benefit Show w/ The Darby Brothers,,,,http://www.darbybrothers.com,5890,"<p>The Darby Brothers invite you to take a trip with us to the exciting world of live music and visual sensations. We love to play epic songs from the last four decades and have fun doing it!</p><p>Our mission is simple; live, laugh &amp; love!

With an all-acoustic mix of genres hailed by Rolling Stone as ""inspired, lunatic brilliance,"" what other band can boast of appearances on both NPR's All Things Considered and The Bob &amp; Tom Show?</p><p>Mommy Says No!, the group's sixth studio album, features an inspired approach to childhood that one pundit likened to ""Dan Hicks meets Dan Zanes.""  In the best tradition of classic Warner Bros. cartoons, the album is full of the sort of inside joke that will appeal to the Spankers' decidedly adult fans, even while the disc's sounds and themes catch the ears of children.</p><p>Though family-friendly, Mommy Says No! pulls no punches in musical sophistication or songwriting.  Addressing childhood from both kids' and adult perspectives, the songs nod to Dr. Seuss, Maurice Sendak, and Shel Silverstein in their clear-eyed view of the joys and anxieties of being a kid.  Gorgeously produced, it's a rich listening experience for kids of all ages.</p><p>""With their first family-oriented disc, they've suitably upped the mania... you'll catch yourself wishing that your own CD collection was this much fun."" <em>-Newsweek</em></p><p>""Full of the Spankers' usual encyclopedic acoustica, impeccable musicianship and giddy fun..."" <em>-High Bias</em></p><p>""A delightfully odd album that has something for everyone.. rarely does something &lsquo;all-ages' actually satisfy all ages, but the Asylum Street Spankers certainly succeed."" <em>-Rambles</em></p>",,,,,1707,Mista Forty,,,,,0,,,,,,1706,Dia,http://www.myspace.com/dia82,,,,6659,"<p>Out of South Arlington comes the DMV's most unique &amp; diverse artist, Dia. As he states ""If Linkin Park had Lupe Fiasco and production done by Daft Punk, you get me."" With a strong fan base that continues to grow Dia out sells most DMV artists. From killin tracks to murdering live performances Dia is in a league of his own. With beat boxers, break dancers, costumes, skits, and live bands, Dia is a complete entertainer. In 2007, Dia scored his first smash record ""I Wanna"" with fellow underground emcee Illnovelist. The single was a commercial success and even appeared on the movie soundtrack for "" Running on Empty Dreams"". He followed that up in 2008, with the political and inspirational track entitled ""Obama"" with Baltimore emcee Jade Fox and Rrice which was an attack at the republican party. Which started a buzz. Then in 2009 Midieast welcomed Dia aboard for their assault on the DMV. With the team that consists of Frayz, 2Face ya WildBoy, Rated R, and Rob Rugah. Dia brings something new to the table. Here in 2010, Dia is already back at it! The new preview of his album leaked thru the DMV streets. And after the underground buzz was growing, Dia has been killing live performances all thru the DMV including being a headline artist on the ""The Loud Tour"". This momentum has made Dia's album ""Broken Halo"" one of the most anticipated releases of the year. Dia is also currently remaking the Beastie Boys classic ""Sabotage"", along with Innerloop records' J-Scrilla. With DMV Legend 2Face ya Wild Boy engineering this new track, this is destined to become another classic. With the album ""Broken Halo"" and Midieast's support Dia hopes to open new doors for all artist. With tracks like his new single ""Alive"" and many to come, Dia has definitely secured his own place in the DMV movement.</p>",,,,,1705,Devon Sproule,,,,,0,,,,,,1703,Meg Hutchinson,http://www.myspace.com/meghutchinson,,http://www.meghutchinson.com/video/index.html,http://www.meghutchinson.com,5820,"<p>Meg Hutchinson is an award-winning songwriter who artfully documents the human condition. With a poet's ease, she makes the personal universal, allowing people's stories to come alive through her unique vocals and haunting melodies. Since the release of her Red House Records debut COME UP FULL, she has won high praise for her songwriting and has been featured nationally on NPR Music, XM/Sirius Radio and several times on the syndicated show Mountain Stage. Publications like The Winnipeg Free Press have compared her songwriting with that of veterans Dar Williams, Mary Chapin Carpenter and Joni Mitchell.</p><p>Growing up in the Berkshire Mountains of Western Massachusetts, the woods and ponds were her childhood muses, as were songwriters like Greg Brown and Joni Mitchell, and poets like Mary Oliver, William Stafford, William Butler Yeats, T. S. Eliot and Robert Frost. When Hutchinson inherited her grandmother's 1957 Martin guitar at age eleven, her love of words found an inspiring instrument, and there was no turning back. ""Songwriting is not something I chose, I've just somehow always known that this is what I love to do. This is what I can't help but do,"" she says.</p><p>After graduating from college with a degree in creative writing, Hutchinson quit her longtime job on an organic lettuce farm and settled in Boston. In between gigs at pubs, coffeehouses and train stations, she won a Kerrville New Folk Award (2000) and was nominated for a Boston Music Award for her first studio album AGAINST THE GREY.</p><p>She went on to win awards at the Rocky Mountain Folks Fest, the Telluride Troubadour Songwriter's Showcase in Colorado and The Chris Austin Songwriting Contest at Merlefest in North Carolina, all in the course of a year, causing national publications like Performing Songwriter to take notice, calling her ""A master of introspective ballads filled with understated yearning and an exquisite sense of metaphor."" She quickly became an integral part of the vibrant Boston songwriting community. Like every great performer who has come out of the Boston scene, Hutchinson took to the subway, performing in Park Street, Downtown Crossing and Davis Square stations-honing her chops in the same method of predecessors like Martin Sexton, John Mayer, Paula Cole and Tracy Chapman.</p><p>After recording her live CD ANY GIVEN DAY in 2001, and continuing to build a fan base throughout the Northeast, she went into the studio with esteemed producer Crit Harmon (Lori McKenna, Martin Sexton, Mary Gauthier) to record THE CROSSING. Released in 2004, this album was enthusiastically received by critics and DJs across the country, catching the attention of renowned folk/roots label Red House Records. Label president and veteran producer Eric Peltoniemi knew there was something special in the young singer-songwriter, ""Meg won me over with the profound yet easy depth of her lyrics-rich words married to melodies I just can't get out of my head."" Knowing her songs could stand alongside those by Red House heavyweights Greg Brown, Eliza Gilkyson and John Gorka, Peltoniemi signed Hutchinson to the label. Teaming up again with Crit Harmon, Hutchinson recorded her Red House debut COME UP FULL over the course of more than a year in Boston. An instant folk hit, the album was one of the most played on folk and college radio and landed her on many ""best of the year"" lists.</p><p>In 2008, Meg Hutchinson went on to tour with such artists as Lori McKenna, Martin Sexton, Susan Werner, Luka Bloom and Joe Pug, handily winning over new fans on both sides of the Atlantic. She was also a favorite at South By Southwest (SXSW) and the International Folk Alliance Conference, showing that this was a young talent to be reckoned with.</p><p>In fall the of 2009, Meg Hutchinson joined fellow songwriters Antje Duvekot, Anne Heaton and Natalia Zukerman to record the holiday EP WINTERBLOOM: TRADITIONS REARRANGED. A collection of eclectic holiday and wintertime tunes, the CD features original and traditional songs from a variety of backgrounds-from a German hymn to a Yiddish folksong to a midwinter Greg Brown ballad. Touring in support of the album, the four women performed concerts in 12 cities, making appearances on such popular stations as WFUV, WUMB and WKSU FolkAlley.</p><p>Now, with the release of her new album THE LIVING SIDE, Meg Hutchinson shows that she is a songwriter that has fully arrived. Combining her raw storytelling folk style with tasteful, intimate production, the album showcases her sweet, earthy vocals and her most powerful songwriting to date. It confirms that she is indeed one of the great voices of the next generation of acoustic musicians.</p>",http://www.meghutchinson.com/music/index.html,,,,1699,Steel Train,http://www.myspace.com/steeltrain,http://www.facebook.com/steeltrain,http://www.youtube.com/user/steeltrainband,http://www.steeltrain.net/,5830,"<p>Set for a June 29th release on the band's recently created label, Terrible Thrills, STEEL TRAIN is an infectious album, produced by Steven McDonald (Be Your Own Pet, Imperial Teen,) that brilliantly showcases a new level of songwriting and musicianship only hinted at in the band's earlier work.  Lead singer and songwriter Jack Antonoff says the album ""is a return to where we come from. We grew up playing legion halls and firehouses and the sound systems were always so bad we had to go ape shit to put on a real show, and somehow that inspired the music and lyrics to reflect all that madness.""</p><p>Steel Train's blend of rock n roll, delivered with boundless energy, appeals to fans from all over the musical spectrum. The band's collection of songs has been praised by Rolling Stone, Spin, Entertainment Weekly, Relix, Esquire, Alternative Press and USA Today, among others, for its huge, exuberant hooks and galloping rhythms set off by a steady attack of guitars and yearning vocals.</p><p>STEEL TRAIN is the follow up to the band's album TRAMPOLINE, which saw the New Jersey natives perform on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and share the stage with The Silversun Pickups, Ben Folds, Gomez and Say Anything, and appear at Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza, to name a few.</p><p>Known for their unhinged live shows, Steel Train is already premiering these new songs to fans on the road; they've spent most of 2010 touring with Tegan and Sara. The band is looking forward to their Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival debut and a headlining tour this June.</p><p>From the epic opening track BULLET to the edgy TURNPIKE GHOST, from the passionate album rock of BEHAVIOR to the rebellious YOU ARE DANGEROUS, this versatile new album brilliantly shows the strength of a band with a mission and as Antonoff adds ""This new record is about getting the fuck out of bed with your mind open to the world - no bitterness.

In 2000, at age 11, an impressionable young Jer went to visit his cousins and saw something on their ""picture box"" that would change his life forever. That of course was the MTV music video for ""Bye Bye Bye"" from &lsquo;N SYNC's platinum selling album, ""No Strings Attached.""</p><p>Was it Justin Timberlake's piercing brown eyes? Or Lance Bass' frosted tips? Maybe it was the group's dazzling dance moves? One thing is for sure, after seeing ""Bye Bye Bye,"" Jer Coons knew he had to be a musician.</p><p>Story:</p><p>For the next eight years, following his first &lsquo;N SYNC experience (a time now simply referred to as ""the revelation""), Jer went through various phases of self-exploration. For a time he studied Scientology under Tom Cruise (also an &lsquo;N SYNC fan), spent many days contemplating Freud, watched the Jersey shore, learned guitar, dated some girls and eventually found himself with enough songs to record an album in 2009.</p><p>That album, Speak, dropped last fall, and you may have heard his song ""Legs"" when your iPod broke and you had to listen to the radio. It is also possible that you heard it while buying some fresh digs at Hollister, grabbing some fresh produce at various chain supermarkets, picking out some fresh paint at Home Depot, purchasing some non-expired (hopefully fresh) contraceptives in CVS pharmacy, taking a nap on a comfy mattress at Big Lots or even while eating The Endless Lunch for only $6.99 at T.G.I. Fridays. Basically, the only way you could have not heard ""Legs,"" is if you shop at Whole Foods or Lowes.</p><p>Today, Jer and his live performances are superior to virtually all singer-songwriters for one important reason:</p><p>&bull; Most singer-songwriters suck. Especially the ones pushing middle age who have seen no real success and now hang by a thread shopping at Urban Outfitters in an attempt to look ten years younger.</p><p>Armed with drop dead catchy melodies, boyish good looks and a charm equal to or greater than Paris Hilton, Jer could wear pleated pants from Eddie Bauer and still look good.</p><p>Epilogue:</p><p>Jer often receives comparisons to many singer-songwriters and performers. Before jumping to any conclusions, take a look at these facts:</p><p>Ke$ha<br />Similarities: Jer and Ke$ha both like to wear Zebra print cat suits. <br />Differences: Jer brushes his teeth with Crest (plus added whitening), not Jack Daniels.</p><p>Jason Mraz<br />Similarities: They both have a huge vocal range and can sing many words in a short amount of time with few pauses<br />Differences: Guys actually listen to Jer Coons</p><p>Justin Bieber<br />Similarities: Jer is from Vermont, which many highly educated people still think is a part of Canada (which of course is where Justin Bieber is from). <br />Differences: Jer's voice improved after puberty.</p><p>Taylor Swift<br />Similarities: They are both young, tall, thin, attractive singer-songwriters with blondish hair (Jer's gets blonder in the summer). <br />Differences: Jer was cheer captain (Taylor was on the bleachers).</p><p>Lil Wayne <br />Similarities: Growing up, both Jer Coons and Lil Wayne spent time in ""time out."" <br />Differences: Jer Coons has never spent time in prison.</p><p>Howie Day<br />Similarities: Both play killer live shows with full bands, or solo acoustic with loop pedals.<br />Differences: When Jer gets a tour bus, he won't lock any fans in its bathroom. <br />Also, Jer has never been addicted to heroin, gone to rehab or dated Brittany Spears in rehab.</p><p>John Mayer<br />John Mayer is probably better than Jer Coons.</p><p>Bono<br />Similarities: Jer can count in Spanish.<br />Differences: Jer's real name is good enough to be his performance name unlike Paul David Hewson.</p><p>Damien Rice<br />Similarities: Jer has traces of Irish in him.<br />Differences: You don't need Zoloft to listen to Jer.</p><p>Kanye West<br />Similarities: Kanye now tries to sing, which we can only assume is because he wants to be like Jer.<br />Differences: Jer is totally modest.</p>",_��_��http://jercoons.com/media/audio/legs1543/legs.mp3.zip,Legs,,,1694,Sally Seltmann,http://www.myspace.com/sallyseltmann,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sally-Seltmann/155137581789,http://www.sallyseltmann.com/moving-pictures/,http://www.sallyseltmann.com,5924,"<p>Australian pop songwriter, Sally Seltmann, has announced a three-week North American tour next month in support of her new full-length, Heart That's Pounding, released last month on Arts &amp; Crafts. Seltmann and her band were over in March performing at Canadian Music Fest in Toronto and at the SXSW Music Conference previewing material off the album, a radiant and glorious collection of songs. The June tour kicks off outside of Washington DC on June 10 and runs through June 30 in Los Angeles, with a return to Toronto for the NXNE Music Conference.</p><p>Heart That's Pounding is Seltmann's first release under her own name, having released two acclaimed full-lengths as New Buffalo. Response to the album has been excellent, finding Seltmann featured in Paste Magazine, and lead single, ""Harmony To My Heartbeat"", to be featured on NPR's ""Song of the Day"" this week. This will be Seltmann's first tour of North America since the fall of 2005 and her first with a full band.</p><p>Some praise for Heart That's Pounding:</p><p>""An upbeat, sublime piece of pop euphoria"" <em>-Venus, 4-Stars </em></p><p>""Sure to be one of the indie hits of the year."" <em>-Blurt </em></p><p>""Songs this good shouldn't go unnoticed for long."" <em>-AccessHollywood.com</em></p>",,,,,1692,The Fold,http://www.myspace.com/thefold,http://www.facebook.com/thefold,http://www.youtube.com/thefoldmusic,http://www.thefoldrock.com,5789,"<p>It all started with a magnet on a friend's refrigerator in Atlanta. The magnet read, ""What would you do if you could not fail?"" It got Dan Castady, the lead singer of Chicago-based alternative rock band The Fold, thinking.</p><p>As Castady considered how easy it would be to give up on making music for a living, he came up with the lyric ""Dear future, come get me."" Suddenly, the concept for the band's first independent album, Dear Future, Come Get Me, was born. However, the path to this revelation wasn't an easy one.</p><p>After releasing two well-received albums on indie power label Tooth &amp; Nail, The Fold decided that it was time to go their own way. The idea of leaving the label and going independent was scary, but Castady and the rest of the band, Aaron Green (guitar), Keith Mochel (bass), and Mike Emmons (drums), rallied to produce yet another quality project, but this time one that would be crafted on their own terms.</p><p>""Leaving our label could have felt like a big failure for The Fold, but it provided the opportunity to tap into our unrealized potential,"" says Castady. Even when the band lost a member, The Fold managed to press forward toward answering their call to play music as an independent band. Instead of fearing what lay ahead, the guys of The Fold decided to take their future into their own hands.</p><p>Released in October 2009, Dear Future, Come Get Me takes a proactive approach, encouraging listeners to live out their dreams. A month before the album's official debut, The Fold released ""Neverender,"" the standout track on the album. Initial reviews were mixed about The Fold's mature new sound, but fans grew to love ""Neverender,"" realizing that, while The Fold had stretched out in a new direction, they had really just built on their already strong melodic rock style.</p><p>The album's title track, ""Dear Future,"" is the cornerstone on which the album is built, according to Castady. ""This album is about reconnecting with our dreams again. It's saying, ?Bring on the future. I'm done with the past.'"" Other strong tracks like ""File: Under Ground,"" ""Sink or Swim,"" and ""These Are My Dreams"" provide a passionate ideological base for The Fold's trademark energetic vocals and strong melodies.</p><p>The guys of The Fold are carving out a path for themselves in the competitive world of independent music. ""We know our sound and we know what we can do well,"" says Castady. ""This doesn't ever have to end as long as we have the passion to keep doing it.""</p><p>""Neverender"" isn't just the final track on Dear Future, Come Get Me. It describes the band's whole outlook on their future. With their new creative independence, the Fold's story is far from ending. In fact, it's just beginning.</p>",,,,,1690,Englishman and Shango Band,,,,http://englishman-shangoband.net,5784,"<p>The Shango Band is a D.C. area reggae group that sings about real life and current world issues with a likeable mix of smooth, lovers-edged tunes and harder, more ""true"" roots tunes.

Across the Pacific and Atlantic-from Australia to Asia, the US and UK-stunned audiences have been mesmerised and transformed, one at a time, by the extraordinary talent that is Kate Miller-Heidke. Now, following double-platinum sales for her last album (2008's Curiouser), sets at Coachella, international dates supporting Ben Folds, acclaimed opera performances in Australia and the UK, and catching US critics-from the New York Times to the New Yorker-off-guard, Kate Miller-Heidke returns with Nightflight, her first solo album in three years.

It was from his late grandfather, who had written the letter when it was clear he had little time left to live. His grandfather requested the letter be handed to Mikey when he was a young man ready to enter ""the real world."" Inside were words of love and wisdom to make up for lost time that the two would never share together. Inspired by his grandfathers words, Mikey began pursuing a music career to show the world the songs he had quietly been writing in his college dorm room. The collection of songs, written over a four-year period, eventually turned into his debut album titled ""Change Again."" The album deals with change, uncertainty, love, and loss, which is displayed beautifully in the title track ""In Case I Go Again""<br />Strong word of mouth through popular social networking sites like facebook and myspace helped debut his album at 46 on the iTunes US top 100 pop albums chart in November, 2008. The album continued to grow, eventually charting on the iTunes top 100 pop albums in Canada, Australia and the UK. ""In Case I Go Again"" was selected as the winner of The Unsigned Artist radio contest held by South Florida's leading top-40 station WRMF/97.9 FM, and the song has most recently aired on the popular CBS television show Ghost Whisperer on April 9th, 2010.</p><p>Mikey released a new 6 song EP titled ""For Better Or Worse"" in February, 2010 to follow up the success of his first independent release. The EP reached #88 on the iTunes top 100 pop charts in it's first week. The release was followed by a month-long tour opening for singer/songwriter Howie Day. The past two years, Mikey has shared the stage with many reputable artists including Serena Ryder, Tyler Hilton, Graham Colton, Diane Birch, and Ryan Cabrera to name a few.</p><p>On April 27th, 2010, Wax released his 3rd album, ""The Traveler"".

Artifice has replaced art, style trumps substance. Sincerity and honesty got lost along the way. Once in a while though, something breaks through. It can crack the shell of bitterness and send a memo reminding us that it's entirely possible we haven't become too jaded, at least not yet. That's where The Uglysuit and their selftitled record come in.</p><p>Made up of six friends from Oklahoma City ranging in age from 20-23, The Uglysuit brings a different mentality to what they do - remarkably fresh-faced and honest, the band believes in letting loose, fostering a heartfelt atmosphere of hope and love, and works hard to shape what comes naturally. Playing together since their early teen years has given them an almost familial connection which shines through on their beautiful, fully-realized debut album.</p><p>The comfort and ease The Uglysuit shares in performing together is evident in the direction each song takes. Some start as one thing and end as something completely different, but in a way that fits together perfectly. Nothing is sacrificed and everything makes sense. ""Brownblue's Passing"" begins delicately before orchestral elements take a march-like turn, leading to a finale that becomes increasingly hypnotic and epic. ""...And We Became Sunshine"" opens with a bouncy intro that eventually transforms into a soaring chorus of guitar washes, keyboard flourishes, and lush, layered vocals. ""Chicago"" brings together a more traditional song structure, a melody painted with piano and delicate guitar lines, and a refrain that can stay embedded in your brain for days.</p><p>The Uglysuit's music is an extended love song to the notion that everything is possible, yet nothing is guaranteed. It's born of excitement and energy and built on potential and promise. It's based on the premise that change exists in everything, and where a wide-eyed view of the world doesn't equal naivet&eacute;.

With seven members and no leader, this band is pulled in every direction imaginable, but thanks to their unique instrumentation they are able to merge their spontaneous creativity into one, solid sound.</p><p>The members of the band- Sarah Anderson, vocals and trumpet; sisters Esm&eacute; and Genny Patterson, vocals; Tyler Archuletta, trombone; Paul DeHaven, guitar; Caleb Summeril, banjo; Macon Terry, upright bass - bring a Folk, Americana sound that pays homage to the American Bandstand of the 1950's, with a hint of Roaring 20's flare. But don't be thrown off by their old-timey sound, Paper Bird maintains the Indie rock image and resonance of the current age with a progressive and complex style that keeps them on the forefront of the music scene. The band's inception came a few years ago in Breckenridge, Colorado where they met for the first time. The members were busking in the streets where they earned a couple hundred dollars, bought some beers and dinner and decided to form a band. Shortly after they went into the studio and recorded their first self-released album Anything Nameless and Joymaking (2007), which has been a top selling record in local retail stores since its release.</p><p>The seven-piece Americana Folk band is boasted by three female lead singers and backed by outstandingly talented musicians, continually capture the hearts of new and old listeners. They were recently featured on NPR's All Things Considered due their rare and beautiful approach to music. They were voted in the Top 10 Best Underground Bands by Denver Post two years in a row. In the last year they have played Red Rocks Amphitheater to over 8000 people and have shared the stage with Devotchka, These United States, Grace Potter &amp; the Nocturnals, Brett Dennen, and Big Head Todd &amp; the Monsters. Their haunting and authentic sound is a refreshing and breath taking experience.</p><p>The female vocals create a soulful, dynamic harmony that accentuates each singer, while giving the illusion of a single voice. The trombone, banjo, and guitar elevate the music to a higher level while the skilled notes of the bass reflect the harmonies. Each style bounces off the other, while each note appreciates the other. They make audiences feel love, excitement, and passion.

It may hide in your radio, your iPod, or in the trunk of your car. Whether you can hear it or not - bad music is out there. Not sure if you're a victim? Ask yourself this question: Have you heard a song and not liked it, only to be bombarded with the same song 34,090,834,098 times until you finally gave in and started liking it? Ever listened to a CD by a band and you literally can't tell one song from the next because they all have the same bland sound? The news media may not cover it much, but we've all been criminally assaulted by bad music. It's time we stand up and tell the world we won't be victims any longer.</p><p>While many other bands have succumbed to the unstoppable and subversive force that is bad music, a dynamic trio by the name of NoCo (aka ""No Compromise"") has surfaced to stand for all that is right and save rock music! Putting aside their massive egos to form an incredible alliance, the members of NoCo bonded together after a near-lame experience at a Nickelback concert. Fleeing for their lives and barely escaping with their ears intact, Jack, Justin, and Will realized they had a duty - nay destiny - to restore hope to the rock faithful by holding themselves to higher standards of musicianship and songwriting.</p><p>Launching from their secret headquarters just outside the nation's capital, NoCo banded together to cleanup the streets and save rock music... because bad music is criminal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>THE ONLY... the coolest new sound in Pop/Rock. 2010 saw DC area singer/songwriter/rock keyboardist Gabe White team up with guitarist Nate Dellinger, bassist Christian Mikkelsen and drummer Bobby Spencer to form THE ONLY. With killer hooks and heartfelt lyrics, THE ONLY emerged as one of the freshest sounds in pop/rock. Their first concert was winning the GMU battle of the bands - one week later they opened for national recording stars ""Plain White Tees"". They never looked back.</p><p>White's venerable keyboard talent is reminiscent of 70's-rock-giants-meets-contemporary-pop-feel, while he superbly handles front man duties. Dellinger's guitar sounds are a great mix of rock history creating very lush and crisp voicings. Bassist Mikkelsen sets the grove and never wavers except to lay down some really kicking turnarounds. Spencer melds it all together on drums and THE ONLY puts out a huge sound complimenting their part brit-rock/ameri-pop style. The songs are awesome on CD - and even better live.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">The Only</span> <a href=""http://theonly.bandcamp.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/_theonly_"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thebandonly"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/thebandonly?sk=app_178091127385"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/watchtheonly"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fnoco%252Fid344892390%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/nocorock,,1624,Caroline Herring CD Release,,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Caroline-Herring/71530870168?ref=search&sid=1630230045.3472001612..1,http://www.youtube.com/artist/caroline_herring/videos,http://www.carolineherring.com,16282,"<p>Recently featured on Garrison Keillor's A Prairie Home Companion, and NPR's All Things Considered, Caroline Herring is on a roll. Her recent album, Golden Apples of the Sun was selected as a ""top ten"" best folk album by the Boston Globe, and also earned a composition award from the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters. Emboldened by the critical acclaim of her recent work, Herring continues to create what Vintage Guitar has called ""musical tapestries full of dark landscapes, bittersweet images, and otherworldly moments."" As usual, Herring draws inspiration from a wide range of sources. From her 2001 debut Twilight and its immediate successor Wellspring (2003) to the widely acclaimed Lantana (2008), Herring's music has been hailed for combining traditional sounds with striking, original observations into modern life and love. The Austin Chronicle proclaimed Lantana to be ""the best modern Southern Gothic album since Lucinda Williams' &lsquo;Sweet Old World.'"" On Golden Apples of the Sun, Herring stakes out new terrain, exchanging the country-influenced sound of her previous albums for a darker, hauntingly personal sound inspired by the iconic female folk singers and songwriters of the 1960s and 70s. ""There's no getting rid of my accent,"" she says slyly, ""but other than that, this is not a twangy record. It's not roots-based."" The new record suggests that Herring has been as much influenced by classic songstresses such as Joni Mitchell and Judy Collins as by her native Southland.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fcaroline-herring%252Fid48722838%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/Carolineherring,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/--RMxPB7h-w"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",1622,Paul Cebar Tomorrow Sound Dance Party,http://www.myspace.com/paulcebartommorowsound,,,http://www.paulcebar.com,6063,"<p>""Paul Cebar has been a primary investigator and promulgator of funky Afro-Carib-inflected Americana since the &lsquo;80's....

They put a lively spin on all sorts of American strains, from second-line to funk to zydeco and they do it with a load of whimsy."" <em>-JIM MACNIE, THE VILLAGE VOICE</em></p><p>PAUL CEBAR has steadfastly pursued a musical concatenation that is one part early R&amp;B, another Pan-African Lilt, Afro-Cuban by way of New Orleans Slither, qualified by Mid-Western Soul and further distinguished by a gargan- tuan regard for spoken English.</p><p>TOMMOROW SOUND NOW FOR YES MUSIC PEOPLE, the newest addition to the Cebar catalog, boasts both the open-hearted spontaneous soulful- ness we've come to expect from this dedicated musician (Who Can Love Who?, The Same Dog, Marv's Fluttering Guitar, I'm Qualified) and wild- headed, crazyquilt conjuring (Knock It To Me, Like A Gentleman Oughta, Spread That Sugar) that feels like a bold contemporary invigoration of the inviting verities he has always explored. There's the meaty Hey Hey Honey, a delightful a capella nod to Alan Lomax and his recording of Norfolk's Bright Lights Quartet, a tender tribute to Sierra Leone's King of Palmwine Music, S.E. Rogie in his Do Me Justice, and Paul's glorious homage to guitarist Marv Tarplin, Smokey Robinson's right hand man for the last 40 years, Marv's Flut- tering Guitar. Add the classic New Orleans swagger of I Got Trouble (replete with Cebar's Jessie Hill-inspired tambourine machinations) and the storming plea for tenderness The Gimp Sparrow (richly reflecting the influence of Paul's travels in Cuba, Brazil and Trinidad), and it's clear that this is a romp of colossal heart and scope.</p><p>The years since the release of the last studio album have been spent touring continu- ally and intensifying the fervor with which Cebar has always infused his music. The guitar tones have taken on an edgier, more distinctive concision. Longtime cohort Bob Jennings comes to the fore on organ and horns in his sneakily apt and piquant less-is-more-ism. Drummer Reggie Bordeaux is simply a stone joy throughout lifting all and sundry to new heights of funk and drive. Bassist Patrick Patterson lays it low and mean in a thoroughly righteous display of bone-deep musicality. Percussionist Romero Beverly insinuates, articulates and pitches a veritable storm (witness Her New Church why don'tcha!!).</p><p>From the Hot Chocolate meets Latin Playboys skank of How'd You Get Like That? to the stately Muscle Shoals balladry of I'm Qualified, featuring Nick Lowe's brotherly back-up vocals, TOMMOROW SOUND NOW FOR YES MUSIC PEOPLE is the best batch yet of of an endangered strain of fortified, intensi- fied, fully jacked-up, roaring and exceedingly personal music-making from a singular Midwestern master. It may be time for all sorts of things, but it is high time for Paul Cebar.

The south east Londoners have sold more than a million copies of their three hit albums (the other two being 2005's &lsquo;Tourist' and 2007's &lsquo;Beyond The Neighbourhood'); packed out venues across the land; picked up an Ivor Novello award; and topped both the UK's album and airplay charts.</p><p>&lsquo;Black Swan', their fourth album, is a musical summary of everything Athlete have been through; the good, the bad and the ugly. But although its songs burn with literate emotion, this certainly isn't a downbeat record. In fact, the album begins with the hurtling FM rush of glorious first single, &lsquo;Superhuman Touch', which catapults the album into life with the opening line, ""I'm on fire and nothing's gonna hold me back"".</p><p>The album reaches its climax with &lsquo;The Awkward Goodbye', an intensely personal tale of love slipping away; the snappy &lsquo;Magical Mistakes', a giddy gush of proud, parental love; and &lsquo;Rubik's Cube' which, according to Joel, ""Sums everything up. It's about puzzling through life, working it out as you go along and having to deal with its uncertainties.

What started as a one night stand at a party has quickly turned into one of the most powerful forces in the LA music scene. Kyler England, Rob Giles, Adrianne Gonzalez and Gabriel Mann, all successful singer-songwriters in their own right, joined together to form The Rescues and created a new, compelling sound where dark meets light, hope meets peril and grace is found in unexpected places. Their chemistry is evident at their explosive, emotional live shows, where devoted fans line up around the block to catch a glimpse and feel the energy. In their performances and their songwriting, The Rescues strive to find new ways to express beauty and the music industry has taken note. Five Rescues songs have been featured on Grey's Anatomy this season alone, and their song ""Break Me Out"" was featured in national TV spots for the feature film Love Happens (Jennifer Aniston/Aaron Eckhart) and Lifetime's hit new show Drop Dead Diva, among others. LA Weekly says, ""Their voices take flight. Soaring and gorgeous."" The Rescues EP is available now, and will be followed by their full-length debut on Universal Republic.

The new album is produced by Lou Giordano (Taking Back Sunday, We The Kings, Goo Goo Dolls) and is co-produced by Ace Enders.  The New York based quintet have sold over 40,000 albums to date with their two previous independent releases.  The band formed in 2003 right out of high school and has spent the last four years on the road playing the Vans Warped Tour and Bamboozle as well as touring with such bands as The Starting Line, All Time Low, Bayside, Set Your Goals, We The Kings, Taking Back Sunday, and more.

Two years and nearly three tour later, the group released their sophomore release, We're in Like Sin to rave reviews with Absolutepunk calling the music """"catchy and wonderfully angsty.""   MTV.com has compared the band to ""Fall Out Boy infused with My Chemical Romance.""</p><p>While their roots are dug deeply into the backdrop of small-town New York, Just Surrender's sound is the product of an urban dance-theme meshed with classic harmony and scorching vocals. The result is a catchiness that is both hot and cool, tight yet spontaneous. On stage, they are a force like none other - dueling vocals alongside stomping percussion and scathing guitar. In the studio, the songs they create, like ""Body Language and Bad Habits"" and ""Your Life and Mine,"" envelop any soundscape with an unheard, unique presence. It's the sound of change, and Just Surrender is pleased to cross any boundary to initiate a gutsy, new, phantom sound.<br /> <br />Just Surrender has already scratched the surface of the pop circuit - that much is certain. But with their massive grassroots base and their genuine appreciation for their fans, the group plans on building on their notoriety the old-fashioned way - through unchecked talent and a dominant ambition.</p>",,,,,1610,SONGS FOR CF BENEFIT CONCERT,,http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=378164067243&ref=mf#!/pages/Songs-for-CF/108884502474210?ref=ts,,http://www.cff.org/Great_Strides/GraceFrinks6010,5584,"<p><em></em></p><p>Reston Great Strides for Cystic Fibrosis presents a surprise guest performer!

With JASON AND THE SCORCHERS, he pioneered the fusion of punk rock and country that turned the music world on its ear in the mid-1980s. Their first record, LOST AND FOUND, still shows up on critics' ""best of the 1980s"" lists, and there is an exhibit of them in the COUNTRY MUSIC HALL OF FAME. When Jason went solo in 1999, the LONDON TIMES called him ""one of the most dynamic live performers of his generation."" In 2008 the AMERICANA MUSIC ASSOCIATION awarded the band their LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD. Jason could rest easily, assured that his place in rock &lsquo;n' roll history was secure.</p><p>However, with two sweet, beautiful, preschool daughters missing Daddy Jason during his 200 dates a year touring schedule, Jason wanted to make a cd that his kids could listen to while he was out globetrotting. Since they lived on a small farm near Bon Aqua, Tennessee, and Jason grew up on an Illinois hog farm, he reckoned that a roots oriented record about farming and farm animals was just the ticket. Hence the first Farmer Jason cd, A DAY AT THE FARM WITH FARMER JASON, was born. He released it ""purely for fun"" in the fall of 2003, delighted to hear his daughters singing along. That was the peak of his ambition for it.</p><p>To his surprise, soon lots of other daughters and little sons were singing along as well. Disney's magazine FAMILY FUN called it ""one of the Top 5 Family CDs of 2003."" Farmer Jason, Jason Ringenberg's ""twin brother"" (wink wink), was soon doing concerts from inner city schools in Brooklyn to country fairs in rural Norway. In 2006 he released ROCKIN' IN THE FOREST WITH FARMER JASON. With its stick in your head hooks and subtle lessons about ecology and nature appreciation, the record earned rave reviews, including the PARENTS CHOICE GOLD AWARD. Its success generated even heavier touring around the world, including many major European and US festivals. At the huge STAGECOACH festival USA TODAY called the Farmer Jason show ""one of the most memorable of the festival.""</p><p>In Tennessee, Nashville Public Television took notice of this new sensation in their back yard, and produced an educational interstitial video series starring Farmer Jason based on songs from the two cds called IT'S A FARMER JASON! To everyone's delight and surprise, the program won an EMMY AWARD for BEST CHILDREN'S PROGRAM MID SOUTH REGION in 2009. Using those videos and more new footage, Farmer Jason released the IT'S A...FARMER JASON! DVD in May of 2009. One reviewer for DADNABBIT called it ""...instantly memorable fun... everything you would want in entertainment for your young ones.""</p><p>What started out as a simple side project to entertain his own daughters has grown into a worldwide band wagon pulled by a tractor and a singing farmer. You can bet the tractor will keep on rolling.

He may not have won the competition, but the 22-year-old Texan earned himself a devoted fan base eager to hear what he would do once freed to perform his own songs. Those folks will get their chance with the release of Castro's self-titled debut album on Atlantic Records.</p><p>Though rooted in the classic, melody-minded singer-songwriter tradition, with heart-on- sleeve lyrics and acoustic guitar-driven arrangements, the album brims with toe-tapping pop (first single ""Let's Just Fall In Love Again,"" ""This Heart Of Mine""), strummy folk (""That's What I'm Here For,"" the lilting ""If I Were You""), and electrifying rock (""Closer,"" ""Heart of Stone"") - all cleverly balanced with unabashedly emotional tunes like ""Love Uncompromised,"" ""It Matters To Me,"" ""You Can Always Come Home,"" and a stunning version of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" (which Castro performed on Idol, citing Jeff Buckley's version as a huge inspiration to him as an artist).</p><p>To capture the moods he wanted, Castro collaborated with producer Eric Rosse (Sara Bareilles, Tori Amos) and a host of top-notch songwriters - including Marc Roberge of O.A.R., Gregg Wattenberg (Five For Fighting), Zac Maloy (David Cook), and Espionage (Train) - all of whom helped Castro create an earthy showcase for his considerable gifts as a vocalist, songwriter, and musician, not to mention the warmth and sincerity that shines through everything he does. ""I feel like the album really captures my personality,"" Castro says. ""People got to know me a bit on the show, so I wanted to build on that by including all these songs I've written about my life. I wanted to share with people the things that are meaningful to me.""</p><p>Those who watched Castro on American Idol are by now familiar with his likeably down- to-earth personality and aw-shucks demeanor. But when he opens his mouth to sing, it's like watching a totally different person. Any offbeat quirkiness seems to fall away and the listener is struck by an authentic maturity and the spell-binding intimacy of his voice. ""I'm actually a pretty serious guy, and that's the side people didn't see on the show and wouldn't see unless you're my best friend,"" Castro says. ""These songs represent that other side of my personality - the more reflective, thoughtful side. I really think music is an extension of one's self. One can't go without the other, so my personality and character are a huge part of the music and that's what people have told me they love about it-just the realness and that they can feel my heart and the emotion in the songs when I perform them.""</p><p>Making that connection is a satisfying accomplishment for Castro, who actually began his performing life as a drummer. A first-generation American of Colombian descent, Castro grew up in a musical family in Rowlett, Texas, just outside of Dallas. His grandfather was an opera singer and his father and all five of his uncles sing and play guitar. Castro started playing drums in the fifth grade (""because I didn't want to be like<br />everyone else"") and played in bands throughout high school. After graduating, he entered Texas A&amp;M University and bought a guitar because he couldn't play drums in the dorm. ""I couldn't sing when I picked up the guitar,"" Castro says. ""So I read about singing techniques on the Internet, like how-to articles with breathing exercises, and taught myself.""</p><p>Ever the perfectionist, Castro didn't want anyone in the dorms to hear him, so he'd go across the street to a park to practice. ""I would sing out while sitting at a picnic table in this park in the middle of the night,"" he says, ""and if anyone came within walking distance, I would be silent until they were out of sight. That was the most privacy I could get."" Also during that time, Castro drove home every weekend to play shows with his band and would listen to all different types of music on the three-hour drive. ""That's when I started loving pop singer-songwriter stuff,"" he says. ""I loved melodies and had fun singing along while making these long drives."" He'd also seek out acoustic versions of songs he liked and teach himself how to play them on his guitar.</p><p>During his sophomore year of college, Castro quit his band to focus on school, a turn of events that he now credits with making him see how badly he actually wanted and needed to be a professional musician. ""I was absolutely miserable. It was the worst year of my life,"" he says. Not long after, needing to get some things off his chest, he began writing songs and experimenting with working them out on the guitar. Eventually, he got up the nerve to perform at local coffeehouses where meeting other songwriters served as further inspiration. During his last semester at college, he lived in a house full of musicians. ""That's when I realized I couldn't live without music,"" he says.</p><p>In August 2007, Castro decided to try out for American Idol (an experience he calls ""an awesome boot camp for singers"") when the auditions were held in Dallas. ""I had watched Chris Daughtry do something different on the show and I started scheming, like, &lsquo;There hasn't really been anyone on Idol like me - a serious singer-songwriter who plays guitar.'"" After impressing the judges, he made it to Hollywood. Week after week, he won over audiences with a number of memorable performances (""Over the Rainbow,"" ""Daydream,"" and ""Hallelujah"" to name a few) accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and ukulele (the show's first-ever contestant to play an instrument onstage). Castro's rendition of ""Over the Rainbow"" hit No. 1 on iTunes, while ""Hallelujah"" proved such an audience favorite that Jeff Buckley's cover of the song hit No. 1 on the iTunes chart the following week, selling an astonishing 178,000 digital singles, and propelling the song to platinum status. After the season's conclusion, Castro hit the road, performing on the hugely successful ""American Idols LIVE! Tour 2008.""</p><p>When the tour ended, Castro moved to Los Angeles and began writing songs, eventually signing a deal with Atlantic Records, because he felt the folks at the label understood his desire to make an authentic artistic recording. ""Some people come off of Idol and sing what's given to them, which is cool, but I sing because it's an outlet for me to express the things I want to say. Atlantic understood that and wanted to help me take my writing and performing to the next level."" Castro went into the studio with Eric Rosse in June 2009 to start recording his first album. ""Overall our focus was to keep it really natural and not lose the magic of the voice,"" Castro says. ""When you play with a band, the vocals can sometimes get washed away, so we tried to pull back whatever wasn't necessary. Eric has a history of making really organic, but still commercially appealing records. I couldn't have done it without him.""</p><p>The result is a truly heartfelt record about love that relays what Castro calls a positive message of love and acceptance. ""That's really the common thread running through the songs - loving somebody and accepting them for who they are."" Though many of the songs are personal to him, Castro doesn't mind giving listeners a view into his world.</p><p>""I don't think there's a limit in art on how much of yourself you put into it,"" he says. ""That's the purpose and the magic of it - sharing something so deep that it can impact somebody else. When it moves you to hear about someone else's experience, that's what songwriting is truly all about: translating your feelings and passions to create meaning for others. That's what I try to do every time I write a song or sing one on stage. And hopefully that's what I've done with this album.""</p>",,,,,1590,Leslie West (from Mountain),,,,http://www.mountainrockband.com,5718,"<p>Leslie West has gained fame the world over during his 30-plus year career as one of the most innovative and influential musicians in the history of rock music. He is most noted for his role as leader of the explosive hard rock trio, Mountain, which was named by VH-1 as one of the Top 100 Hard Rock Groups of all time. With Mountain, he climbed the heights of rock stardom on the strength of a unique, signature guitar sound and classic songs such as ""Mississippi Queen"", ""Never In My Life"", ""Theme From An Imaginary Western"", and ""Nantucket Sleighride"" which are still staples of rock radio to this day. Leslie has earned the admiration of a long list of famous peers. During his career, he has recorded or played with a litany of rock icons including Billy Joel, Van Halen, The Who, Mick Jagger and Jimi Hendrix, to name just a few. In fact, Eddie Van Halen, Michael Schenker and Richie Sambora have all cited Leslie as an important influence on their own music.</p><p>Leslie's bold, expressive and unique guitar style is really a mirror of his own personality. Spend a little time talking with this larger-than-life figure, and you'll realize that he is as charismatic without a guitar in his hands as he is with one. Possessing a sharp sense of humor, he is at once gregarious and gruff while recounting stories from his legendary past. And when discussing his newest projects, he exudes an infectious enthusiasm and excitement.</p><p>But Leslie has never been one to rest on his impressive laurels. His boundless creativity has often involved him in projects that take him outside his traditional roles of guitarist, singer and songwriter.</p><p>In 1986, he acted alongside Tom Hanks and Shelley Long in the hit comedy film, The Money Pit and has lent his distinctive voice to the popular animated series, Beast Wars Transformers which ran for three seasons on the WB network beginning in 1996 before going into syndication. He has also contributed the theme music to the new WB show, Mutant X.</p><p>Leslie has long been a popular personality on the Howard Stern Radio Show and was Musical Director for the shock jock's FOX series, as well as for the late comedian Sam Kinison. Most recently, he lent his production and songwriting skills to an album by Atlantic Records' modern rock group, Clutch, and has just released his own instructional guitar DVD, Big Phat Ass Guitar.</p><p>Leslie West has been a creative force for over three decades and shows no sign of losing his ambition or his desire to continually reinvent himself. His ability to adapt his creative spirit to a diverse range of projects is a key ingredient in the longevity of this multi-faceted entertainer's success. All humans have a unique fingerprint. In the world of guitar, Leslie has that distictive sound and tone that is unique to him. There many clones, but few who have voice of their own. When Leslie hits a note, you know it's him and that's what makes him one of a kind.</p>",,,,,1588,"David Johansen (New York Dolls, Buster Poindexter)",http://www.myspace.com/newyorkdolls,,,,6111,"<p>An Evening With David Johansen will present the singer songwriter side of the multi-faceted entertainer, featuring songs from New York Dolls, his solo recordings with The David Johansen Band, Buster Poindexter, The Harry Smiths and back to the reformed New York Dolls who in the last four years, have released two critically acclaimed CD's, ""One Day It Will Please Us To Remember Even This"" and the recent ""Cause I Sez So.""</p><p>""I've been wanting to sing a bunch of songs unplugged that I don't normally get the opportunity to sing in a loud and fast Dolls show.

The Paul Q. Kolderie (Radiohead, Lemonheads, Juliana Hatfield) produced album is a ""fiery"" (NY Times) ten song collection of five originals and five choice re-imaginations of Borges' and Kolderie's favorites including ""Ride With Me"" written by fellow Boston native Evan Dando. The album opens with the honky-tonk infused punk rocker, ""Do It For Free"" showcasing Borges' smoky, honeyed vocals and scorching guitar work. This driving ode to an old flame would be right at home on the Sunset Strip in 1978 - Borges declares, ""I never forget what my mama said to me, when it's real love, you do it for free."" Originals ""Me and Your Ghost"" and ""Symphony"" combine the band's rockabilly, blues and rock and roll aesthetics and center on Borges' trademark lead vocals and capture the band's raucous and good time live act. She takes ""Being With You"" (most famously recorded by Smokey Robinson) and transforms it into a bittersweet lament accompanied by gospel like backing vocals when she pleads, ""I don't care about anything else but being with you."" &lsquo;The Stars Are Out' is a worthy follow up to 2007's &lsquo;Diamonds in the Dark'which drew praise across the board from the likes of The Boston Globe (""the playfully charismatic Borges truly shines""), Time Out New York (""irresistible"") and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (""just a whole lot of fun"").

Later on, perhaps in the nineteen eighties he started to sing in a strange breathless way, cramming too many words into odd amounts of bars and found himself, with his group of twee schoolboy punks, Del Amitri, getting firmly up the collective nose of the Glasgow white-soul cognoscenti. Much more loathed than loved, and revelling in their outsider status, Del Amitri attracted a dense little coterie of followers in the United States of America who duly set up a nationwide tour funded by busking, badge selling and the refrigerators of those fans' generous parents. Driven half-mental by their experiences the group came home, ditched their indie twiddling and embarked upon a course of songwriting so sickeningly mainstream and Americanised that it led to a long career being spoilt stupid by the radio and recording industries of the English speaking world. Limos to the pub, ponds full of chips, week-long parties in Bognor, that sort of thing.</p><p>By 2002 the thing had run it's cliched course; the group's fortunes were dwindling and, dropped by a record firm grown weary of their whining, the two chief writers put the band into cryogenic suspension and set about writing two LPs; a Justin Currie Alone affair and an entirely co-written electronic pop masterpiece. Justin's solo record is called ""What Is Love For?"" and features eleven thunderously dreary dirges many of which he is currently airing live to pained looking crowds of people in dingy Glasgow basements. When forced by penury, politeness or acute fear he can sometimes also be heard to trawl out tired versions of his withered hits.</p><p>Justin is unmarried and lives a quiet life of standing up and sitting down in Scotland with his two pet television sets.</p>",,,,,1573,Sleeperstar,http://www.myspace.com/sleeperstar,http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5672794799,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bjJcc2WWs0,,5647,,,,,,1559,Half Brother,,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Half-Brother/374042306411,,,15461,"<p>Half Brother and The Jefferson Davis Highway String Band are playing another show together!

For the past two years, he's been putting his musical roots down in Charlottesville. One of the principle songwriters of EFO, Clem continues to hone his left of center lyrics in neo-traditional forms with his newly formed trio.  Filling out this threesome is veteran Rusty Speidel (SGGL) on lead guitar, and holding down the low end is Berkeley School of Music grad Thomas Gunn on upright bass, who both help round out Clem's new batch of originals with harmonies and considerably greater height.</p><p>""A songwriter, a guitarist and observational comedian...

From small towns to big cities, they explode on stage with spirit, spontaneity, and a style all their own. Paste Magazine chimes, ""It's no easy task to find a country/folk haystack buried amongst noisy New York needles, but this winsome three piece rewards the hunter."" The band has achieved many milestones over the last year including an appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, their first ever performance on NPR's Mountain Stage with Drive By Truckers, and ""The Rock Boat IX"", as well as national touring stints with Squeeze, The Old 97's, and many others.	Additionally, the band has received immense support and airplay from the country's #1 Triple A radio station New York's WRXP - appearing multiple times on both, ""The Rock Show with Matt Pinfield and Leslie Fram"", and Rich Russo's ""Anything Anything"" as well as performing a duet with Matt Pinfield as part of the WRXP Holiday Extravaganza held at NY's Hammerstein Ballroom.</p><p>NY MAGAZINE praised the trio saying: ""Tight, soaring harmonies were set against old country twang as the band exuded a pure, childlike joy of playing as many instruments simultaneously as possible. Dressed in a black prom dress, front woman Heather Robb jumped around the stage like the unaffected younger sister of Karen O, banging on pretty much everything in sight, Including a snare drum, keyboard, and glockenspiel.""</p><p>The band's performance set-up is as distinctive as their sound: They take a drum kit and break it up among the three of them, and then they set up along the front of the stage. So, whoever is playing bass (James and James alternate between bass and guitar,) is also stepping on a kick drum...and whoever is playing guitar is also stepping on the high hat (and sometimes playing harmonica simultaneously). Heather, in the middle, switches between melodica, keys, glockenspiel and snare drum, often playing several at a time. And even with all this going on, their harmonies are astounding.</p>",,,,,1523,Cadillac Sky,http://www.myspace.com/cadillacsky,http://www.facebook.com/cadillacsky,http://cadillacsky.net/csky/media,http://cadillacsky.net,5159,"<p>""Original"", ""innovative"", ""fearless"", ""ambitious"", ""propulsive"", ""a marvel of emotion and razor sharp focus""....These are the words of those that have had a chance to hear and witness the sound that has been reverberating out of Texas from one of American music's most compelling bands, Cadillac Sky. Their chosen instrumentation that imitates that of Bill Monroe's classic bands belies the depth of sound that these five young men create and becomes simply the canvass that they paint from. Their music draws inspiration from many diverse wells of creativity and artistry. But somehow they manage to create a sound that is completely Cadillac Sky: one that rejects the straitjacket of labeling and instead looks to make transcendent music and ultimately to paint its masterpiece. The five sincere young men of Cadillac Sky recognize that there are few things that have not been said musically over the past 500 years of creativity and are of the belief that their only chance in becoming special is in the sharing of their own personal experiences and perspective whether they are of the rest of the world's momentary opinion or not; musical or otherwise.</p><p>This summer Cadillac Sky started discussing plans to take another step in that direction, to go back into the studio to make their third full-length album of music. Dead set on capturing once and for all who they were on tape, the ideas on who would captain that ship began to surface. Unbeknownst to them their last record had fallen in the hands of guitarist/producer Dan Auerbach of the acclaimed rock band, The Black Keys, who had heard something in the acoustic upstarts that incited his musical ear. That led to five days in September in Dan's own studio, Akron Analog, where they recorded what Mr. Auerbach at the end of session would call ""their first record"". A recording that is truly a ""record"", a ""sonic time capsule"", of who they are and what they sincerely sound like, not a product of studio manipulation. Set for release in the spring of 2010- it's a record that's relentlessly honest in message, spirit, and sound.</p><p>But as we know, the place where the rubber meets the road for any band is summed up in the question: can you touch an audience with your music face to face on a nightly basis? The boys ever-increasing following solemnly attests to the fact that the ferocity and grace that are the staples of Cadillac Sky are best understood when witnessed first hand. Folkwax wrote about a recent live performance ""they completely blew me away, they were jogging around on the top of their strings, sniffing out new territory with rampant curiosity."" Obviously, the relationship between artist and audience can change from night to night. But it does not take even the most lethargic of audiences long to be propelled to their feet with enthusiasm once they start to feel the transfer of honest energy that occurs every time Cadillac Sky takes the stage.</p><p>The road for a young band is not easy. It is steady diet of humbling moments, seemingly endless sacrifice, and a lifestyle that doesn't seem long for this Earth. Bryan, Matt, Ross, Panda, and David all agree that playing music for money, or fame, or any reason other than the simple fact that you believe music is what God has put on your heart to do would be a unrewarding waste of<br />a life. They play from the heart because it is their heart.</p>",,,,,1521,The Heavy Pets,,,http://www.theheavypets.com/the-gallery/,http://www.theheavypets.com,5093,"<p>The Heavy Pets are five South Florida musicians renowned for their explosive live performances and catchy original tunes that showcase a unique rock-fusion.

Combined with the classic rock she grew up listening to - The Allman Brothers, Dr. John and Hendrix - it is the musical center of gravity she brought to her 2002 Capitol Records debut Jukebox Sparrow, gaining notice from Rolling Stone, The New York Times, Leno and Letterman. This decidedly rare approach for a woman drew the same accolades for indie-based Geronimo, helmed by Charlie Sexton.  Now, on the self-produced Coldwater, McNally leads her Mississippi-based band, Hot Sauce through the juncture where country and soul music meet - made all the more powerful by the keys of the late, great Jim Dickinson (one of his last recordings.)<br /> <br />McNally says, ""I strive to combine femininity with the simple, dry way that male rock singers deliver their lines. There's no affectation, it's just the raw lyrics where you can hear the words."" This is most evident on ""Lonesome, Ornery and Mean,"" a Waylon Jennings outlaw hit. And she knows how to combine her love of a male-dominated genre with her own very womanly sensibilities on the bluesy lead-off track, ""This Ain't My Home,"" a testimony to female solidarity - ""little sister let me tell you, just how perfect you are/little sister let me tell you I can't stand to see you starve."" ""It's commentary on the hyper-grooming-hyper critical idea of beauty that our culture and we women put on ourselves,"" says McNally. There's also the sultry ""Lovely,"" about long lazy mornings with coffee in bed.<br /> <br />Shannon McNally and Hot Sauce toured with The Derek Trucks Band in December and touring solo throughout 2010 in support of Coldwater.

Last year's critically acclaimed ""Oooh La-La!""

The 27-year-old singer-songwriter and fiddle player spent nearly two decades-all of her teenage and young adult life-as one-third of Nickel Creek, the Grammy Award-winning acoustic trio that used contemporary bluegrass as a starting point for its no-genre-barred sound. Along the way, she's hinted at her desire to do a project of her own and even organized some exploratory sessions in Los Angeles about six years ago. Now, with Nickel Creek on indefinite hiatus, she is releasing her self-titled solo disc, recorded in Los Angeles and Nashville and produced by former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. It features an impressively wide range of backing players and old friends, including itinerant alt-country duo Gillian Welch and Dave Rawling, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers keyboardist Benmont Tench, Elvis Costello drummer Pete Thomas; fellow travelers from the bluegrass world like Tim O'Brien, Chris Eldridge, Ronnie McCoury and Rayna Gellert; and her Nickel Creek bandmates.</p><p>""Listening back to the finished record,"" Watkins says, ""it felt very natural. It is authentically me. I know that has so much to do with the process, with the years that I had been playing with all these guys, with the relationships I've made. I come from bluegrass and I wanted that to be part of the record. On the other hand, I've spent most of my life playing things that were not bluegrass, but maybe related to it, so all of the instrumentation and all of these players mean something to me. There are a lot of Nashville musicians on the record that I grew up performing with and players from L.A. who are musical heroes of mine. Even though not all of the songs on the album are my songs, it's still really personal because I lived with this material for so long and I've played a lot of this music with the performers who are on it.""</p><p>Watkins' debut has an air of easygoing virtuosity. She displays her skill as a multi-instrumentalist, playing the guitar and ukulele as well as the fiddle, and proves herself to be just as versatile, and breathtakingly mature, as a vocalist. Watkins segues gracefully from the lighthearted country and western swing of Jimmie Rodger's ""Any Old Time,"" to the world-weariness and spiritual yearning of Norman Blake's ""Lord Won't You Help Me,"" to the romantic wistfulness of Jon Brion's ""Same Mistake."" Though she still considers herself a neophyte as a songwriter, her own work is as evocative as any of the material she's chosen to cover. Her wordless fiddle tunes are exuberant, foot-stomping pieces, while the songs for which she wrote both music and lyrics have a heart-meltingly lovelorn quality. There's honesty and empathy on tracks like the sweetly soulful ""My Friend,"" the brooding ""Bygones,"" and the rueful album closer, ""Where Will You Be."" Watkins is newly, and very happily, married, but she knows how to channel the plaintive emotions of classic country and timeless pop in her own work.</p><p>""In terms of song selection."" Watkins explains, ""I didn't have a goal of making this a country record or a folk record. I didn't want to avoid anything-except faking it. This was a chance to make a record that doesn't represent anyone else but me. That's a totally new thing and kind of felt selfish at first, but I'm starting to embrace it a lot more. I love being part of a team and I love bands so much, but I'm also learning to really enjoy figuring out what I specifically add to a band. In all these different situations, in sessions and playing with other friends, what exactly is it? How do I express what my musicianship is? It's been really fun learning about that, developing it, trying to refine it.""</p><p>In 1989, Watkins, barely out of her childhood, started playing in a nascent version of Nickel Creek at the seemingly unlikely venue of That Pizza Place in Carlsbad, California, along with her guitarist brother Sean and mandolinist friend Chris Thile (and chaperoned, of course, by her bluegrass-playing parents). The prodigious young trio built a reputation in bluegrass, folk, and country circles, then catapulted to mainstream prominence in 2000 after releasing an album produced by Alison Krauss. When not on the road or in the studio with Nickel Creek, Watkins guest-starred as fiddler and/or harmony vocalist on albums by Bela Fleck, the Chieftains, Ben Lee, Dan Wilson, Richard Thompson, and Ray La Montagne, among others. In addition, Watkins and brother Sean established an informal get-up-and-jam residency called the Watkins Family Hour at L.A. club Largo, ""an uber-cool but cozy music and comedy club in Hollywood,"" as Sean has put it.</p><p>Watkins brings the spirit of the long-running Watkins Family Hour to her debut. It was there, in fact, that she developed and fine-tuned the repertoire for the album: ""I had lived with a lot of this material for a while. It was tested and tweaked through the years playing at Largo. Songs would come and go; these are the songs that have stuck. Some are newer than others-'Lord Won't You Help Me' was a deliberate choice for the record. Some I had done for years, like Jon's &lsquo;Same Mistakes.' &lsquo;Too Much' is a David Garza song, and I always loved it.""</p><p>John Paul Jones, who'd briefly toured during 2004 with Nickel Creek and Toad the Wet Sprocket lead singer Glenn Phillips in an ad hoc group called Mutual Admiration Society, had long encouraged Watkins to make a record of her own, offering his services well before she was ready to hit the studio. As Watkins recalls, laughing, ""A couple of years ago we saw John Paul Jones at the Cambridge folk festival. He came up after our performance and said that if I didn't let him produce my record he would never speak to me again. I was thrilled that he was that excited about it. He actually stayed with it and kept in touch. At that point, in Cambridge, I believe we had already talked about winding down the Nickel Creek touring, so it was a really convenient time and it helped me stay focused. It was a perfect moment to start transferring over the creative energy.""</p><p>Jones kept a familial atmosphere, and maintained an unobtrusive presence, in the studio, says Watkins: ""I think he was allowing the band to be a band and play for each other, rather than have us play through a song, then look to see if that's what he was or wasn't looking for. Eventually, John would give us his feedback and directions to guide us in. I think that has a lot to do with the sound of the record being band-oriented, especially considering there were a lot of different musicians coming in."" Cutting John Hartford's ""Long Hot Summer Day"" was especially inspired-with Rawlings playing ""caveman drums,"" Welch strapping on an electric guitar, and Watkins revving up everyone with her fiddle playing. The compellingly straightforward arrangements she and Jones devised allow Watkins' personality to come through, illustrating both her sensitivity and her strength.

When Michelle Shocked says this about herself, it's hard not to crack up. &lsquo;Hillbilly,' after all, is no compliment. And frankly, it's tough to reconcile that reflex image of a backwoods, overalls-and-a-smile hillbilly with this focused, erudite singer-songwriter. If such a creature exists, however, Shocked is its picture, sans Billy-Bob teeth. Come to think of it, after being &lsquo;prematurely conceived' to teenaged parents, she was born near the backdoor of East Texas' Piney Woods.</p><p>Her upbringing was slightly more urbane. In early childhood, Shocked logged thousands of miles as a military brat, living in Massachusetts, Germany and Maryland, before returning to Texas in her teens. Until her early twenties, she experienced the dubious juxtaposition of school years spent with her fundamentalist Mormon, U.S. Army-lifer stepfather and mother, and summers with her free-wheeling &lsquo;late-blooming hippie,' autodidact father. Eager to expand her horizons, Shocked eventually decamped for San Francisco, assumed the peripatetic life of a community activist and, eventually, a touring musician.   Fittingly, there's a phantom Texas taproot and that self-styled wanderlust in her music. Much like the work of her East Texas peers Willie Nelson, Victoria Williams and Clarence ""Gatemouth"" Brown, Shocked's songs hold fast to a definite core, but owe no stylistic allegiance - just like their itinerant, mercurial, utilitarian creators.</p><p>In a 24-year career that has seen critical acclaim at every juncture, she famously escaped major-label indentured servitude in 1996, subverting the artist-label relationship that helped lead to the current trend toward artistic self-containment. She has made good use of her independence, releasing more critically-acclaimed albums on her Mighty Sound label. Her 2009 album, Soul of My Soul, was the latest of these. In 2010, she launched Roadworks, an ongoing, 5-year touring project which curates audience's favorite songs while developing new, unreleased material.</p><p>For example, 2011 Roadwork's theme, &lsquo;Campfire Girl,' celebrates the 25thAnniversary of the release of her unauthorized debut album, The Texas Campfire Tapes. Her solo set will recapture the raw intimacy of a portrait of the artist as a young woman, and refresh memories of that audacious introduction. In addition, along with a trio of sassy singers accompanying her in a girl group/doo-wop style, she'll introduce new songs from her not-yet-recorded series, Indelible Women; a duet with visual artist David Willardson featuring portraits painted in song of such female icons as Audrey Hepburn, Amelia Earhart, Ella Fitzgerald and Anne Frank to accompany the startling images Willardson has recorded on canvas. While she's at it, don't be surprised if she works a pitch for support of arts education in public schools into the act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/michelle-shocked/id1471916?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/MShocked,,1473,Official MOJO Mixtape Release Party,http://www.myspace.com/mojomusicva,http://www.facebook.com/mojomusicva,,,7567,"<p>Music Over Judgment and Oppression aka MOJO is an up and coming band from the Washington D.C./Northern Virgina area who combines Reggae,Roots,Dub,Ska and Hip Hop to create a sound that cannot be categorized.

Their second album, ""Heat Treatment,"" followed six months later, garnering similar critical reaction and propelled Parker to international recognition.</p><p>That same year, a 4-track EP, featuring a cover of the Trammps' ""Hold Back The Night,"" claimed the band two appearances on Top Of The Pops and gave them a UK top twenty single.</p><p>Their third album, ""Stick To Me,"" (1977) made the UK top 20 and ""The Parkerilla,"" a three-sided live album, reached #14 in the spring of 1978. ""Parkerilla"" spawned a hit single with the re-recorded and somewhat discofied version of Howlin' Wind's epic ""Don't Ask Me Questions.""</p><p>The bands' classic 1979 release, ""Squeezing Out Sparks,"" cemented their position as one of Britain's top live acts and ensured sell out concerts on their seemingly endless world tours. ""The Up Escalator"" followed in 1980, reaching #11 on the UK charts and sold well throughout the world.</p><p>GP and The Rumour disbanded after ""Escalator"" and Parker went on to forge a solo career that continues to produce powerful work including 1988's ""The Mona Lisa's Sister,"" 1991's ""Struck By Lightning"" and the hard rocking ""Acid Bubblegum,"" released in 1996.</p><p>Dozens of compilations are available on a variety of record labels and Parker continues to tour frequently, sometimes with backing musicians but more often as a solo act.</p><p>In June 2000, Parker released ""Carp Fishing On Valium,"" a collection of short fiction published by St. Martin's Press (US) and Simon &amp; Schuster (UK). He composed songs to compliment the stories and took ""Carp Fishing On Valium &Ntilde; the Stories, the Songs"" on the road in September/October 2000. The book was also published in paperback in May 2001.</p><p>Parker's first four albums plus a collection of lost demos and the fabled ""Live at Marble Arch"" were recently re-released by Universal in the U.K.</p><p>The powerful and eclectic ""Deepcut To Nowhere"" was released on August 21st, 2001 on Razor and Tie and was voted one of the ten best albums of the year by Sound And Vision magazine</p><p>In November, 2003, Thunder's Mouth Press published Parker's new novel, ""The Other Life Of Brian.""</p><p>(Graham wrote a surreal, comedic novel, ""The Great Trouser Mystery"" when he was just 21. The book was finally published in the UK in 1980 with illustrations by Willy Smax.)</p><p>In 2004 Parker released ""Your Country"" on Chicago's Bloodshot Records, a rootsy collection that included a cover of Jerry Garcia's ""Sugaree.""

These influences can be felt in his songs, but certainly do not define them. ""The music from that time period contains so much charm and honesty. I'm constantly hoping to create something that catches people the same way"".</p><p>Drawing on the inspiration from his musical heroes, Billy sought create something completely different; to develop his own, truly unique style. The result is a new, refreshingly energetic rock and roll experience. Billy's live performances are full-throttle and rockin' from start to end, drawing the audience in as if they were part of the performance.</p><p>Billy Woodward hit the Washington DC music scene in 2008 after organizing a full band of some of the finest local musicians. Since that point Billy Woodward and the Senders have had the pleasure of sharing the stage with such varied touring acts as Three Bad Jacks, Th' Legendary Shack Shakers &amp; Thomas Nicholas Band.</p><p>The varied influences brought by Billy's band, The Senders are an integral ingredient to the fresh and energetic smashing crash. Their large sound and bursting live performances have fast become legend within the DC music scene.</p><p>With an undeniable rock and roll soul and deep appreciation for the raw manner of the Replacements and Chuck Berry, lead guitarist Mike Amacher adds an unprocessed, well-suited compatibility to Billy's rock-solid rhythm guitar. The occasional Townshend-esque abandon adds to the intensity of the band's raucous, not-to-be-missed live set.</p><p>Double bassist Mike Centrella combines equal parts tasteful backbone with raw and driving intensity. Mikey's punk rock influences being quite apparent as he mercilessly pounds his intense rhythm through his poor, harangued upright. It can appear at times that he's actually persuaded himself he's got an electric strapped on... At all times he appears possessed.</p><p>Scott rabino rounds the rhythm section with his precision timing and old skool jazz sensibilities. Scott, a well-known veteran to the local music scene, lends an acute, hypnotic-yet-pounding, unrelenting beat that provides the foundation for the bands' irresistibly hip-shakin' music.</p><p>Scotty Miller adds to the musical landscape by laying down his beautifully melodic, honky tonk piano styling. An ardent fan of Faces and The Stones, as well as being a badgerous Stax aficionado, Scotty's infectious piano hooks beautifully weave in and out of the music-riding the crest and then back down below the surface in brilliant harmony. Scotty is also a brilliant maracas maestro.</p>",,,,,1461,Aqualung,http://www.myspace.com/aqualung,http://www.facebook.com/AqualungOfficial,,http://www.aqualung.net,4873,"<p>""Music can be an amazingly potent thing,"" says Matt Hales, aka Aqualung. ""When I sing into the microphone in the studio, I'm whispering my secrets in people's ears. When it connects, it can be so powerful. It's still a remarkable process to me.""</p><p>Indeed, in a field crowded with empty shouting, Words and Music-the English singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist/producer's fourth album (and third U.S. release) under his longstanding nom de disc Aqualung-has the feeling of a series of deep emotional truths whispered in confidence. An effortlessly intimate set of subtly crafted, organically melodic tunes with openhearted lyrics and spare, mostly acoustic arrangements, Words and Music features some of Hales' most compelling work to date. Such subtly soulful tunes as ""7 Keys,"" ""Arrivals,"" ""Good Goodnight"" and ""When I Finally Get My Own Place"" balance adult emotional insight and childlike wonder, and are squarely in the tradition of such introspective pop auteurs as Brian Wilson and Paul Simon. Not coincidentally, Simon's '70s classic ""Slip Sliding Away"" receives a poignant interpretation from Hales on the album.</p><p>Words and Music-which Hales co-produced with his brother and musical right-hand man Ben, who also provides guitar, bass and harmony vocals, and co-wrote several songs-is the product of an extended period of soul-searching that caused the artist to seriously reexamine his career priorities, after a life that's been spent making music.</p><p>Hales began writing songs at the age of four and won a music scholarship at 16, and soon saw his classical symphony Life Cycle performed by a 60-piece orchestra. He later achieved a modicum of U.K. notoriety with a pair of British rock combos, Ruth and The 45's, but eventually grew weary of band life. Hales began recording as Aqualung in 2002, and achieved some unexpected early success when his demo of the song ""Strange and Beautiful"" appeared in a Volkswagen TV commercial and immediately struck a chord with listeners. That fluke occurrence turned Aqualung from a modest lo-fi bedroom recording project into a successful major-label act.</p><p>Hales' first two U.K. albums, Aqualung and Still Life were combined to create Aqualung's first U.S. release Strange and Beautiful, which became a substantial stateside hit. Meanwhile, Hales demonstrated the flexibility of his songcraft by presenting his music in a variety of live formats, from solo piano performances to gigs with a four-piece band to concerts with a 17-person ensemble. The conflicting emotions generated by Hales' unexpected mainstream success were reflected in 2007's Memory Man, a densely packed, largely electronic meditation on the disconnection and dislocation that Hales was feeling at the time. Those emotions left the lifelong musician and songwriter unsure of whether he wanted to continue as a recording artist.</p><p>""I'd been on the road for about three years, and I was as unwell and as unhappy as I've ever been,"" he recalls. ""I thought, 'This is absolutely ridiculous, how can this be the result of success?' I felt like I was completely done, and like I had to stop. So I came home and hung out with my family and got busy producing and writing for other people, and had a think about what I might do next. But then I started to write some songs, and I eventually came back to realizing how much I would miss it if I gave it up. I realized that I just had to find a way to carry on, but on my own terms.""</p><p>Eventually, Hales and his brother Ben began cutting unfussed, stripped-down recordings in Matt's home studio, with little thought of releasing them to the public. ""It was really me and my brother sitting at home in London, just seeing what would happen if we tried out this sound or this tone. Initially, we were just playing around with new versions of old songs, but then I started writing new songs, and it grew and grew, and at some point it started feeling like a record.""</p><p>""I wasn't really expecting anyone to want to release it, to be honest,"" Hales adds. ""It was really more of an experiment for me, because after having made a deliberately synthetic record with Memory Man, I was reacting against that and wanting to make something that was entirely organic and furry.""</p><p>The almost-accidental nature of Words and Music's birth cycle is consistent with the unpremeditated manner in which Aqualung first came into being, and Hales is happy to be returning to his D.I.Y. roots. ""Ever since I began making music,"" he says, ""my best work has come from a sense of feeling at home and connected and grounded and safe and happy. And this record, which was made without any external pressures or timetables or plan, came from that place, and connected me back to that. Listening to it, I feel relieved and rescued.""</p><p>""I nearly called this album Heart Songs, because that's sort of what they are,"" Hales notes. ""Memory Man was completely a head record, but Words and Music is all heart. It barely has a head; it's basically just a heart and a grin. There's something about the spirit of these recordings that feels like the start of something new. I don't know exactly where it will take me, but it will be very interesting to find out.""</p>",,,,,1457,Bill Emerson and Sweet Dixie Band CD Release Party,,,,http://www.bluegrassville.com/BillEmerson/,5286,"<p>Beginning in 1957, Bill Emerson established himself as a banjo virtuoso and history maker alike! A founding member of the famed bluegrass ensemble ""The Country Gentlemen"", billed as a featured artist while with ""Jimmy Martin"" during the height of that bluegrass legend's career, the man who introduced the classic ""Fox on the Run"" to bluegrass, founder and shaper of ""Country Current"" the world renowned bluegrass ensemble of the United States Navy Band. Called ""a banjo legend"" by the ""Washington Post"", twice awarded ""Banjo player of the Year"" by the Muleskinner News Bluegrass Magazine, credited with giving start to the careers of both dobro legends Mike Auldridge and Jerry Douglas, credited by Ricky Skaggs as being responsible for his post Ralph Stanley musical career, Bill Emerson was also inducted into the ""Virginia Folk Music Association"" Hall of Fame in 1984 and June 10th was proclaimed ""Bill Emerson Day"" by the governor.</p><p>In 2000 Bill was inducted into the SPBGMA Preservation Hall of Greats during ceremonies at the 26th Annual Bluegrass Music Awards Show in Nashville Tennessee.

Reed practices a flamboyant ""self-invented"" style, characterized by percussive techniques and simultaneous rhythm and melody lines that dance and ricochet around each other, giving his music a level of excitement that is unparalleled among today's guitarists.</p><p>Playing an array of guitars from acoustic to electric to classical Reeds vast range of explosively original music will forever change your expectation of a guitarist.</p><p>First-time listeners find it impossible to believe that they're hearing just the one musician, in real time. Reed attacks the entire instrument in a never-ending search for the orchestra he knows is lurking inside. At full tilt, his fingers, thumbs, fists and hands at once suggest a drummer, keyboardist, bassist and several guitarists at work.</p><p>The most impressive thing about Reed's technique, though, is that it doesn't draw attention to itself. His compositions are far from abstract virtuosic displays; even without lyrics he creates vivid, engrossing scenes. Sometimes the effect is almost onomatopoetic. Reed generates visual stimuli with every tweak of his instrument, thus augmenting his wordless compositions with an aura of the poetic. Each tune is a story in itself with a potent, cinematic atmosphere and an almost tangible thread of communication between Preston Reed and the listener.</p>",,,,,1452,Power Pirate,,,,,0,,,,,,1451,Elementary,http://www.myspace.com/elementaryband,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Elementary/53567323870?ref=mf,,http://www.elementarytheband.com,4993,,,,,,1449,Cash Cash,http://myspace.com/cashcash,http://facebook.com/cashcash,http://youtube.com/cashcashmusic,http://www.cashcashmusic.com/,0,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p><strong><span style=""color: #800000;""><br /></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style=""color: #800000;""><br /></span></strong></p><p>Cash Cash is an exciting techno-pop group from the 2 mile long town of Roseland, New Jersey.

As players, they displayed an easy-going virtuosity; as siblings, they had an extraordinary rapport. Their folk and acoustic blues tunes, tinged with gospel hopefulness and country melancholy, were welcomed like old friends by both fans and pundits. National Public Radio named their debut disc one of their top ten discoveries that year. Rolling Stone declared, ""The flip, easygoing party music on &lsquo;Lose' disguises sneakily deep inquiries into what it means to be alive, struggle with temptation, and every once in a while seek some truth.""</p><p>With Loaded, the Wood Brothers engage in a more expansive musical dialogue that commenced well before they hit the studio; they collaborated for the first time on writing material together. John Medeski, returning as producer, got into the mix as the songs were just taking shape, and he plays keyboards on several tracks. The crew, working at a studio near Woodstock, New York, opened up the sessions to other musicians and friends-singers Amos Lee, Pieta Brown and Frazey Ford, steel guitarist Darick Campbell, violinists David Mansfield and Jennifer Choi, cellist David Eggar, drummers Billy Martin and Kenny Wolleson, and percussionist Donnie McCormick-making this a more fleshed-out, multi-layered band effort compared to the spare, live-in-the-studio approach of Ways Not To Lose.</p><p>Oliver still does the lead singing, in a voice that is, by turns, weathered, wounded or yearning, but Chris takes his first lead-vocals turn at the mic on the gentle ""Don't Look Back,"" bolstered by Frazey Ford of Canadian roots music trio The Be Good Tanyas.  Jokes Chris, ""After being in an instrumental band for eighteen years, it was pretty weird to be stuck in front a microphone. When MMW fans see us play, they say, that's the first time I ever heard you speak, much less sing.""</p><p>""We initially just brought our songs and our musicianship to the table,"" continues Chris, ""We had a chemistry that was good and we captured that on the first record. It's been almost two years now and, having played constantly for the last two years together and written things together, we've just evolved. We have different things to say, different things are happening in our lives, and we combined our efforts much more. That combined voice has taken us to a different place and this record illustrates that.""</p><p>Songwriting, as well as playing gigs, became an important connection for the brothers, as Oliver explains, ""Chris and I live pretty far apart, so unless we're on the road, we really don't see each other. A lot of times one of us will start a song, introduce some music or some lyric. It took a little while, but we got used to the idea of getting the other person involved to where both of us have our hearts invested in a song. That's a different feeling than, &lsquo;Hey, here's my song, let's play it together.' It's different for both of us to have something at stake there.""</p><p>Most importantly, their songwriting and playing got them through some tough times for their family, Oliver says, ""We lost our mom last spring to ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease. She was deteriorating over the last year or two, so we couldn't help but have that influence what we were feeling and what we were writing about. It's a unique situation because we are working together, but we're also family, so we were both hit in kind of the same way by the passing of our mom. That definitely shows up in the music quite a bit.""</p><p>Loaded is bookended with a pair of wistful tunes, ""Lovin' Arms"" and ""Still Close,"" that address loss but also hint at spiritual regeneration. That's a theme that recurs throughout the album.  For the Wood Brothers, the blues offer solace from downheartedness; there's a soulful quality in their work that grows increasingly compelling-not to mention, comforting-the more familiar these songs become. ""Postcards From Hell"" takes the Robert Johnson legend and flips it, telling the story of a singer who manages to keep his sound pure by closely guarding his soul. ""Pray Enough"" brings humor to a gospel exhortation, with label-mate Amos Lee joining in on backup vocals. (Lee reappears later in the album to swap verses of Jimi Hendrix's ""Angel"" with Oliver.) And there's real tenderness to ""Walkaway,"" an understatedly arranged breakup number in shuffle time, with drums from Chris's MMW band-mate Billy Martin.</p><p>Along with ""Angel,"" the Wood Brothers cover the traditional ""Make Me A Pallet On Your Floor,"" turning it into a loose back-porch jam highlighted by Donnie McCormick who adds vocals and percussion by rhythmically scratching the wires of a chicken coop (""with no chickens in it,"" Oliver hastens to add). The lilting melody of Bob Dylan's ""Buckets Of Rain"" unfolds in a beautiful slo-mo tempo, with Oliver playing stop-start guitar leads. He hesitates before singing each line, as if he's pulling poetry right out of the air. Says Chris, ""Oliver has a magical way of playing behind the beat, an amazing laid back thing, one of those indescribable things that you can't teach. Either you've got it or you don't.""</p><p>Though the pair had a good time in the studio with their extended lineup, they plan to hit the road again simply as a duo. Multi-tasking on their individual instruments, they can cook up a mighty groove or create a seriously laid-back mood. Oliver admits, ""There is something special about performing as a duo, a uniqueness to it, whereas oftentimes a group with drums and keyboards doesn't stand out as much. In some ways we really stand out as a duo, making a whole bunch of a racket with just the two of us.""</p><p>Chris concurs: ""There is a certain flexibility we have as just the two of us that we are learning to take advantage of more and more. When you don't have a drummer back there, you can really play with the rhythm, slow down a phrase or speed it up, and be more liquid that way.""</p><p>Expect to see-and hear-a lot more of the Wood Brothers this year, on tour and on Loaded.

For San Luis Obispo, Calif.'s Sherwood, those scars come oddly enough in the form of mall security cops. ""We've been kicked out of probably 40 malls,"" vocalist and bassist Nate Henry says of the group's early days back in 2004 when it peddled its musical wares in front of department stores and food courts. ""I still have fear reflexes around mall security guards; I can't see one without feeling slightly uneasy.""</p><p>Fortunately for Henry and bandmates Michael Leibovich (keys), Dan Koch (guitar/vocals), David Provenzano (guitar/vocals) and Joe Greenetz (drums), those days are far behind, as Sherwood readies to step out full stride on Oct. 13 with its third album Qu.</p><p>Much how bands like Jimmy Eat World and Death Cab for Cutie made their mark on the pop-rock world with breakthrough efforts Bleed American and Transatlanticism, Sherwood positions itself to accomplish the same with the excellent Qu, an album that showcases the true depth of the band's songwriting skills along with its uncanny ability to win you over with the simplest of Beach Boys-inspired pop hooks.</p><p>Formed in 2002 while attending Cal Poly State University, Sherwood first built a steady following around a self-released EP and self-booked tours in 2004. Eventually, the band's dogged work ethic landed it a slot on that year's Vans Warped Tour and caught the attention of SideCho Records, who released Sherwood's first full-length, Sing, But Keep Going, in 2005.</p><p>Amid all that activity and more non-stop touring, Sherwood had grabbed the ear of Tom Anderson himself, of MySpace fame, and soon the group was among the first to sign with MySpace Records for the release of Sherwood's second full-length, A Different Light, in 2007. The album racked up sales of more than 50,000 and reached No. 12 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart and No. 38 on the Independent chart.</p><p>To boot, Sherwood's MySpace page has logged an astounding 18 million plays, making it the third largest MySpace profile in the world, and the video preview for ""Song in My Head"" alone notched more than 700,000 views on YouTube and MySpace in less than one week. Helping build on that momentum, the band once again hit the road throughout 2007 and early 2008, playing a successful run of shows alongside the likes of Relient K, Motion City Soundtrack and The Academy Is.</p><p>Not one to rest on their laurels, all band mates were ready to step it up for the new release, devoting themselves full-time to working on their music in a rented apartment in Oakland, Calif., from July 2008 to March 2009. ""It was the first time we experienced what a professional bands' work ethic is supposed to look like,"" Leibovich says. ""In the past, we wrote during breaks in between tours or promotional work, but this time we devoted 7+ hours a day strictly to creating music. We felt like we were testing our limits and abilities.""</p><p>The result was a massive creative output of more than 85 songs, which were eventually whittled down to 12 that made the final cut. In the studio, Sherwood enlisted the magic touch of producer Brad Wood, whose past work with such acclaimed acts as Liz Phair, Smashing Pumpkins and Sunny Day Real Estate proved a valuable asset when combined with Sherwood's knack for crafting unabashed power pop. ""Based on his past history, we were excited to work with him to get a fresh angle on pop/rock, and he was excited to try his hand at a catchy, concise pop album,"" Koch says of working together.</p><p>From the first taste of the gorgeous five-part harmonies of opening track ""Shelter,"" it's clear Sherwood has something special to offer. Though the group's undeniable pop sensibilities have always distinguished it from its alternative and pop-punk peers, Qu expands on that element, highlighting specific moments - be it the shining hook of a chorus, or lyrically, taking you to a particular place in time - and, ultimately, delivering the overall feeling of a band fully realizing its potential.</p><p>Pop gems like the instantly catchy chorus of ""Hit the Bottom"" and the playful melody driving the Rooney-meets-Jimmy Eat World ""Not Gonna Love"" offer a year-round splash of sunshine, as does the feel-good ""Make it Through,"" which bounces along with a simple, lilting ""Whoa oh oh"" chorus, guaranteed to lift spirits of anyone within earshot.</p><p>But don't let Sherwood's bright melodies deceive you - dig deep and there's quite a bit of dark, thought-provoking subject matter to be found. ""We really tried to go for a variety of storytelling and not just rely on our own personal experience,"" Leibovich explains. ""We wanted to get away from an album about love songs and branch out more than we had in the past.""</p><p>And that they did. See ""No Better,"" a somber story about a child experiencing a parents' divorce, or ""Ground Beneath My Feet,"" a piano-led tale of a soldier off at war, which builds into a militaristic beat and swarms with guitar fuzz until you can almost feel yourself among the turmoil.</p><p>Each song tells its own fascinating story, and Sherwood is here to share it with you. Gone are the days of out-running mall security guards, and today finds the band ready to step out with something both artistically viable and instantly likeable. It's time to listen and sing along.</p>",,,,,1423,"Lopez Studios, Inc.

Sometimes it seems so. Onstage they often finish one another's sentences or burst into improvised three-part ditties so tight they seem rehearsed. Truth is, the Atlanta-based trio has had years to develop this rapport. Doris Muramatsu and Tylan Greenstein became best friends in second grade. The two met Nate Borofsky in college at a talent show, and since then they've been creating their own unique language of three-part harmony. Informed by 60s vocal groups like Simon &amp; Garfunkel and The Mamas and the Papas, and infused with years of classical and jazz training, Girlyman's songs are a dance of melody and suspensions - an irresistible blend of acoustic, Americana, and rock The Village Voice calls ""really good, really unexpected, and really different.""</p><p>Everything's Easy, Girlyman's fourth studio album, is the band's most intimate and sophisticated effort. The cover, a playful paint-by-numbers scene, suggests a world where one creates reality with only a brushstroke. Yet much of Girlyman's rare appeal is a willingness to see the shadow side of its own idealism. A placid suburban childhood unfolds amid the mounting pressure of the Watergate era in ""Easy Bake Ovens,"" while the ""one hundred billion metric tons"" of New York City rise beside the wide, unburdened river in ""Hudson."" Some songs highlight Girlyman's trademark playfulness, as in the Tin Pan Alley tribute ""My Eyes Get Misty,"" while the swirling counterpoint of ""Wherever You Keep"" strains musically and lyrically for the light. Self-produced and engineered, Everything's Easy was recorded with a single, ten thousand dollar microphone, financed by fan donations. This microphone, along with the work of Grammy-winning mixer Ben Wisch, has created an immeasurably rich sound.</p><p>Girlyman formed in 2001 in Brooklyn, where the friends shared an apartment; their first rehearsal was scheduled for Tuesday, September 11. It was postponed, but the events of that day helped the trio clarify its vision: ""We decided to just have fun,"" explains Nate, ""and not take ourselves too seriously. We started by naming our new band Girlyman."" Others, however, took the group quite seriously. The first few years brought critical delight, awards, and long opening runs with the Indigo Girls and Dar Williams. Girlyman quickly became a strong headliner in its own right, and now plays in every corner of the country to intensely loyal ""girlyfans"" who often travel hundreds of miles to see shows. Girlyman sells out renowned venues such as The Barns at Wolftrap, The Old Town School of Folk Music in Chicago, The Ark, and The Freight and Salvage. They also frequent festival main stages, making a huge splash this past year at the Ann Arbor Folk Festival, the Kate Wolf Memorial Folk Festival, and the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, to name a few.</p><p>Most recently, Girlyman has been collaborating with comedian Margaret Cho, co-writing songs for her upcoming album, Guitarded. Of Girlyman, Cho says, ""They seamlessly blend folk, country, pop, and rock, and they genre bend as fearlessly and flawlessly as they gender-bend. It's the music of my heart and soul. Girlyman is the future and the past and the present.""</p>",http://www.girlyman.com/store.php?link=themusic,,,,1401,ANAIS MITCHELL CD RELEASE,http://www.myspace.com/anaismitchell,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Anais-Mitchell/67810931360,http://www.youtube.com/user/anaismitchell,http://www.anaismitchell.com,13551,"<p><span style=""color: #ffffff;"">Early show!

In 2010, Righteous Babe Records released the recorded version of her folk opera Hadestown, a modern retelling of the Orpheus myth, featuring guest singers Justin Vernon (Bon Iver), Ani Difranco and Greg Brown. The album became something of a critical phenomenon in the UK, making ""Best of 2010"" lists in the Guardian, Sunday Times and Observer. Young Man is not an opera, but it is an epic tale with multiple protagonists. As a songwriter Mitchell takes on the voices of different characters, men as well as women. If there's a common thread in Mitchell's work-from her earliest ballads, to the opera, to this new chapter-it's that she's as interested in the world around her as the one inside her. She has a way of tackling big themes with the same emotional intimacy most artists use to describe their inner lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Classically trained in voice, piano, violin and viola, Rachel marries sophisticated, at times vintage, musicality to smart lyrics. With a self-taught guitar style reminiscent of Mississippi John Hurt and vocals that at times recall Billie Holiday and early Maria Muldaur, her songs range from the romantic simplicity of jazz standards to the distilled intensity of poet Anne Sexton. Ms. Ries has an adventurous ear for melody and a voice flexible enough to accomplish it. After the 2008 Righteous Babe Records release of country ep, a split 7"" with friend Ana&iuml;s Mitchell, Rachel took a quiet break from the mad scrabble of touring and music-making.  In 2010, ready to start making noise again, she began exploring sounds and forms different from her norm:  from playing electric guitar in a rock &amp; roll version of Wagner's epic Ring Cycle, to writing and recording the music for ReRooted, to learning how to play the drums to tour in Ana&iuml;s' band.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Rachel Ries</span> <a href=""http://rachelries.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/rachelkries"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://myspace.com/rachelries"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/rachelriesmusic"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Frachel-ries%252Fid79652833%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://rachelries.com/video"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fanais-mitchell%252Fid475445573%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/anaismitchell,"<iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/zC2dyde0KTk"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe></br><object height=""136"" width=""100%""> <param name=""movie"" value=""https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1468757""></param> <param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=""always"" height=""136"" src=""https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1468757"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""100%""></embed> </object>  <span><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/wilderland-records/sets/shepherd-anais-mitchell"">Shepherd (Anais Mitchell)</a> by <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/wilderland-records"">Wilderland Records</a></span> ",1399,Brainfang,http://www.myspace.com/brainfangtherockband,,,http://www.brainfang.com/,6551,"<p>Brainfang the Rock Band was formed by David Cotton and Patrick Williams.

He had dealt with an ever-changing band lineup, label switches, personal demons and crises, and the overall ego battering that comes with the current evolution of the music industry. ""It was kind of like VH1's Behind The Music, minus the fame or wealth,"" says the singer-songwriter, whose new album Devil's Made A New Friend will be his debut release under his own name. ""But all of those experiences made me realize how far away I'd gotten from who I really was, as a person and an artist."" Though the past couple years had been a nightmarish rollercoaster ride, they were also part of a crucial rite of passage for Gorbel. By last summer, he knew he had to find a way to create something closer to his own heart: unfiltered, unbiased, produced in a way that didn't veer too far from the songs' original intention. The results are Gorbel's best songs yet, mining classic soul, traditional folk and Americana, and incorporating strings, horns and female backing vocals for a sound more lush and organic than any of his previous work.</p><p>A bit of background: Gorbel gave himself The Honorary Title moniker several years ago, when he was playing solo acoustic shows around New York. The project later evolved into a full-fledged quartet known for the unbridled passion of Gorbel's vocals, his deft pop hooks and keenly observed, poetic lyrics. The self-produced video for their song ""Everything I Once Had"" became a fixture on FUSE and Mtv 2, and the band earned accolades from Rolling Stone (""a soaring, heart-rending debut,"") Spin (which praised Gorbel's ""winning humor and killer pipes,"") and GQ, among others. They spent the better part of five years on the road - including stints with Dashboard Confessional, Switchfoot, Minus the Bear, Tokyo Police Club and Lucero - and, by the time Gorbel retired The Honorary Title name following a final tour last fall, the band had sold more than 75,000 copies of its two full-length albums.</p><p>Gorbel's deceptively simple melodies, warm arrangements and soulful, soaring voice were always what drove The Honorary Title; his new, solo material brings those qualities into crisp focus in a way that makes the details even more beautiful. At his Brooklyn apartment, Gorbel spent week after week locked away with his acoustic guitar, amassing a collection of laptop demos for Devil's Made A New Friend. ""I've always preferred albums with a lot of atmosphere, where production is rich and layered, but you can still identify what each instrument is doing,"" When he considered who would be the ideal producer to help achieve his vision, he immediately thought of Blake Sennett, of Rilo Kiley and The Elected. ""I spent many hours on tour with both The Elected and Rilo Kiley as my soundtrack, and I knew that Blake was such a big part of both those bands' sound,"" says Gorbel. ""I felt honored when he took my phone call and expressed his admiration for the songs I was working on."" Through mutual friends, Gorbel made contact with Sennett and started sending the producer his bedroom demos. After continuous dialogue Blake suggested that they record the record at his Los Angeles home studio.</p><p>In addition to producing, Sennett lent his voice and guitar skills to the entire record. He also put together the perfect backing band for the project, including his fellow Rilo Kiley bandmate and Mystic Valley Band drummer, Jason Boesel, Black Crowes' Adam McDougall on keys/organ, Azure Ray's Orenda Fink on backing vocals, and the incredible Nate Wolcott offering horns and piano. "" Gorbel explains. ""I love the production of old Sixties soul records, where back-up vocals might be panned all the way left and guitar all the way right,"" says Gorbel. ""The technology available at the time dictated some of it, but I really love that kind of separation of instruments. And yet, it was important to me that the music feel like it's capturing a live performance, not something pieced together in the studio. It was really inspiring to play with these musicians, who have worked with other artists I admired so much.""</p><p>For the first time in years, Gorbel was able to record the songs without the supervision of a record label. He had the freedom to take risks with the more folk tinged-songs and had no one to satisfy but himself. This freedom paired with the shedding of the band name gave way to new sounds. From the Seventies folk- and soul-inspired album opener ""Extraordinary,"" to the massive string-led ""I'll Do Better,"" Devil's Made A New Friend is set of 10 songs that capture an artist, as he puts it ""starting over, going back to the beginning, and re-establishing myself.""</p><p>Lyrically, Gorbel has never shied away from exploring the dark corners of his psyche, the fucked-up things people in love can do to each other. On Devil's Made A New Friend, he does this with even greater nuance and maturity. ""Ten Years Older,"" he explains, is ""essentially about the passing of time and the pain of regret,"" while ""Extraordinary"" describes ""the unhealthy necessity for drama and turmoil to spark passion within relationships, and how boredom can become a product of actual stability and contentment."" And the anthemic ""I'll Do Better,"" Gorbel says, was inspired by experiences relating to ""the never-ending cycle of addiction, the promises that come from someone suffering from addiction."" He explains, ""It's written from the perspective of someone who's sort of putting together a letter of apology to a significant other.""</p><p>Though the songs themselves are often somber, when he's on stage Gorbel has become known for conveying an almost schizophrenically comic-side ""I have the type of personality that creates these super-depressed songs,"" he says. ""But as much as things get me down, I find humor in all these absurdly meloncholy situations."" Between songs, Gorbel offers almost Tourrettes-like, profanity-laced observations on topics like burritos, masturbation and alien abductions. ""I've got a ton of nervous energy, and I'm extremely awkward, but unable to supress a lot of my inner ramblings"" he says. ""It surprises people because the songs are so melodramatic and sad, but sometimes i feel the need to balance that with sarcasm its my method of survival ."" Gorbel has also found an outlet for his hilarious outbursts online, and his series of comedic videos on YouTube are as cherished by hardcore fans as their favorite Honorary Title songs.</p><p>Devil's Made A New Friend will be released on August 31st ; after his experiences with traditional labels, Gorbel opted to put out the album as a joint venture with Burning-house records, a new company helmed by a trusted friend and colleague, and his own imprint 'Gorbel Music'. ""At first, it was hard to just accept that I'd have to take a few steps back in order to get where I wanted to go,"" says Gorbel.

Bushwalla's debut EP release Ghetto Blaster (produced by Spooner Oldham) is cherished by fans worldwide and highly acclaimed in the Southern California media and radio circuit.

There the full-length album Autodidactical Freestyle &amp; Radical, released in March of 2008, has been selling at a rapid rate with fantastic reviews on iTunes. Jason Mraz: [Bushwalla's] appearance on all three of my studio releases should be an indicator that he remains to be perhaps my greatest musical influence - certainly in the field of live performance.

His two previous full lengths, released just nine months apart-Let's Just Be and Nuclear Daydream- showcased two different sides of his musical leanings-raw, Stones-y swagger on the former, and meticulously produced atmospheric pop on the latter.

Nonetheless, contributing each of their talents and creative ingenuity, they establish a sweet rock sound that sometimes takes a darker edge. Their influences? There are many, such as The Cranberries, Meg &amp; Dia, and Vedera, who inspire their sound, but others such as Muse, The Cure, and Hotspur who inspire them to make music. In addition, each member also has her own influences who inspire her as a musician. Coming together one memorable summer day, who would've thought they could finish their debut album ""This Adventure"" so fast?

SO we wont. Instead this is what we are going to do. We are going to get right to the point. The Louisiana based band OUTLAW NATION which is comprised of Christian Simeon, Danny Woolen, JB Baker and Jackson White whom are also known as the ""!RUDE BWOY RAWKUZ!"" have been spreading their eclectic brand of music for nearly 10 years that's a decade for all you smarty pants reading this. With a wide array of influences that run from Old School R&amp;B to Heavy Metal to Reggae to Hip Hop and Pop. OUTLAW NATION is none of the above but all of the above at the same time, if that makes sense. OUTLAW NATION'S sound finds the ears of it's listener like a cool breeze blowing in from the Gulf Coast and just like the traditionally native louisiana dish known as GUMBO that gives you a little bit of everything in the pot with it, so does OUTLAW NATION. They pride themselves with being a band you can truly find an assortment of musical joys with them but still see and hear it as one common theme. Lead singer, main songwriter and guitarist Christian Simeon wears his influences on his sleeve. "" I grew up listening to The Police, English Beat and The Clash whom all had huge reggae vibes in their music, but they all had distinctively sounds all their own,"" says Simeon."" "" I also found myself listening to bands like Bad Brains and Fishbone as well so I found many different takes on what people took from the music genre of Reggae and made it their own."" OUTLAW NATION'S latest CD 'NEW DAY' is a collection of songs that found Simeon's common theme. From the first song ""Mr. Fun"" with it's bass heavy groove and beach party theme starts to set a mood for a trip through southern California beach towns on through to the rough streets of south Central LA and Compton with songs like ""Don't Go"" and ""Stripper Girls"". Both tunes play delicately with the reggae influences but are profoundly based in HIP HOP. The band even let's it's rock flag fly hard on songs like "" Reborn"" and ""Dooms Day"" which showcase the bands love for Psychedelic Rock and Southern Rock. (which is an odd kinship that is based on geography more so than lineage) One thing is for sure with this band of musical mystery men. You will never get bored! 'NEW DAY' is packed with winners that make for a great disc for a beach party, a DJ spinning at a club or hell just wanting to spend a night alone.

Sing with the band!</strong></p><p><br />As every family with youngsters in the DC area already knows, Rocknoceros (pronounced like rhinoceros) is three guys: Coach Cotton, Williebob, and Boogie Woogie Bennie. After seeing them perform, there is no denying that they are not a typical trio. Coach Cotton is the ring-leader, frequently immersed in a sea of knee-high concert goers. Wearing a wireless head-set microphone, he wades through the mass of dancing children, dispersing high-fives and shaking a tambourine. Williebob provides the necessary string work for the show, moving among a collection of guitars, mandolins, and banjos while wearing a kazoo around his neck. Boogie Woogie Bennie is a one-man-band within the power trio, employing a contraption that one four-year-old fan described as ""the piano-drum"". The piano-drum allows Boogie Bennie to play the bass drum with his right foot, the snare drum and hi-hat cymbal with his left foot, and the keyboard with his hands (with his left hand playing the bass parts). Together, Rocknoceros is able to cover a dizzying range of musical styles in each set. From Tin Pan Alley to the shores of Jamaica, Rocknoceros hops from genre to genre like a toad on summer asphalt.</p><p>Having already released three award-winning records, Rocknoceros will be releasing their first kid-friendly concept album, ""Colonel Purple Turtle"". The new album tells tales of the Colonel and his friends in their make-believe home of Soggy Bog. The theme of ""Colonel Purple Turtle"" is one of friendship and working together, a subject that matters to Coach, Boogie Woogie Bennie, and Williebob, as the three members of Rockncoeros have been best friends since they were children. The record reflects their abiding trust in each other, and their desire to share the message of camaraderie through song.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Frocknoceros%252Fid258825234%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/#!/coachcotton,"<iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/h7DecJGQvxo"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",1328,"Beth Rinaldo, Scott Holland & Friends CD Release",http://www.myspace.com/bethrinaldoscottholland,,,,4514,"<p>Beth Rinaldo &amp; Scott Holland have been working together for 9 years; first as members of the Wammie award winning Beth-Allison &amp; The Well-Strung Boys and then with the Wammie nominated Big Sky.

After auditioning several singers without luck, the band finally found Adam. The new dynamics of the group helped to jumpstart the band's productivity and Sub-Radio Standard was officially born. The band quickly began writing original songs as well as learning covers. Since 2009, they have successfully recorded a seven-song EP and have many more songs in the making.

""So the next step was to make a record with some of this material. I decided to leave the harmony of the songs pretty close to the originals, but really get into messing with the arrangements.

The full-frontal pop of ""Say It All,"" the woozy morning-after reflection of ""Tragic Mirror ,"" and the 1980s no-wave energy of ""John, Let Me Go"" all showcase Lerche's ability to craft jaunty songs that hold up nicely in their newly sweaty surroundings."" <em>-The Boston Globe, on the 2007 album Phantom Punch</em></p><p>""There's a tendency in our time, subscribing to the idea that anything 'authentic' or 'honest' is automatically good,"" says Sondre Lerche. ""I find that depressing. You have to actually create something. There has to be a process. I try to avoid just singing my diary over a couple of chords.""</p><p>Fighting words? Not quite. Lerche, an award-winning singer-songwriter, newly minted Hollywood go-to man and frequent sighting on critics' year-end ""best albums"" lists, simply believes there's a lot of work that goes into crafting a song. Heartbeat Radio, his fifth studio album and first for Rounder Records, is proof that good art needs time, thought and careful construction. It is a ""generous"" album (his words), and a summation of everything Lerche has learned over the last decade of making music.</p><p>""The records I make seem to be a reaction to the record I did before,"" says the Brooklyn musician, who was born and raised in Norway and returned there to record Heartbeat. ""My last few records were recorded with my backing band, Faces Down, almost live off the floor. And those were a reaction to my first records, which were more studio affairs. On this album, I wanted both: I wanted the physical force and excitement from the live setting and the patience and the endless possibilities of the studio setting.""</p><p>Heartbeat Radio is certainly Lerche's boldest and most challenging record. While it maintains the studio polish of his groundbreaking debut, Faces Down, there's also a sense of musical adventure that stems from his later work. The songs mix acoustic guitars with grand gestures of orchestral pop, with elements of anything from 50s Jazz, via 60s and 70s Brazillian psych-folk to state-of-the-art 80s pop masters such as Prefab Sprout, Scritti Politti and Fleetwood Mac.</p>",,,,,1274,Matt Hires,http://www.myspace.com/matthires,http://www.facebook.com/matthires,http://www.youtube.com/user/MattHires,http://www.matthiresmusic.com/,11951,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.<br /><br /></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you listen to Matt Hires, what comes across is the sound of an artist self-assured, authentic, and at ease with being completely and utterly himself.

At each stop, she collaborated with top-tier production teams, including Fredrik Thomander (*NSYNC, Lady Gaga), Jerry Abbott and Grant Black (Robbie Williams, Britney Spears) and the Wizardz of Oz (MoZella, Britney Spears).

For more than 35 years, his stylings have inspired a whole generation of bluegrass and acoustic musicians. He was not only considered among the very best pickers, he was also one of the instrument's top teachers, and created numerous instructional books, teaching video tapes and cassettes.</p><p>A native of Syracuse, New York, Trischka's interest in banjo was sparked by the Kingston Trio's ""Charlie and the MTA"" in 1963. Two years later, he joined the Down City Ramblers, where he remained through 1971. That year, Trischka made his recording debut on 15 Bluegrass Instrumentals with the band Country Cooking; at the same time, he was also a member of Country Granola. In 1973, he began a two-year stint with Breakfast Special. Between 1974 and 1975, he recorded two solo albums, Bluegrass Light and Heartlands. After one more solo album in 1976, Banjoland, he went on to become musical leader for the Broadway show The Robber Bridegroom. Trischka toured with the show in 1978, the year he also played with the Monroe Doctrine.</p><p>Beginning in 1978, he also played with artists such as Peter Rowan, Richard Greene, and Stacy Phillips. In the early 1980s, he began recording with his new group Skyline, which recorded its first album in 1983. Subsequent albums included Robot Plane Flies over Arkansas (solo, 1983), Stranded in the Moonlight (with Skyline, 1984) and Hill Country (solo, 1985). In 1984, he performed in his first feature film, Foxfire. Three years later, he worked on the soundtrack for Driving Miss Daisy. Trischka produced the Belgian group Gold Rush's No More Angels in 1988. The following year, Skyline recorded its final album, Fire of Grace. He also recorded the theme song for Books on the Air, a popular National Public Radio Show, and continued his affiliation with the network by appearing on Garrison Keillor's Prairie Home Companion, Mountain Stage, From Our Front Porch, and other radio shows. Trischka's solo recordings include 1993's World Turning, 1995's Glory Shone Around: A Christmas Collection and 1999's Bend. New Deal followed in 2003. The new studio album was a bluesy adaptation of bluegrass standards that featured, among other things, a vocal cameo by Loudon Wainwright.</p><p>Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular, featuring an appearance by comedian Steve Martin, Earl Scruggs and many other luminaries, came out four years later. For this recording he went back to Bluegrass and reinvigorated the double banjo tradition of that style along the way and brought along some fine companions. In October 2007, Tony was given an IBMA (International Bluegrass Music Association) award for Banjo Player of the Year 2007. Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular received IBMA awards for Recorded Event of the Year, Instrumental Album of the Year and a Grammy Nomination.</p><p>With his fearless musical curiosity as the guiding force, Tony Trischka's latest critically acclaimed release, Territory roams widely through the banjo's creative terrain. Nine selections partner Tony with fellow banjoists Pete Seeger, Mike Seeger, Bill Evans, Bill Keith, Bruce Molsky, and twelve all-Trischka solo tracks explore a panorama of tunings, banjo sounds, and traditions; tapping the creative potential of America's signature musical instrument.</p><p>Throughout his upcoming tours, Tony will be presenting both his Solo works from Territory and will continue to present an ""astonishing"" (Boston Herald) group of musicians to perform his Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular.</p>",http://www.tonytrischka.com/media.htm#audio,,,,1260,The Automatics,,,,,0,,,,,,1259,Wings of Apollo,http://www.myspace.com/wingsofapollo,,,,4181,,,,,,1257,Luke Mitchem,http://www.myspace.com/lukemitchem,http://www.facebook.com/lukemitchemmusic,http://www.youtube.com/lukemitchemmusic,http://www.lukemitchem.com/,9612,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you crossed Ray Lamontagne's voice with Damien Rice's lyrical intensity, you have Luke Mitchem...</p><p>You will often find Luke in a charcoal vest, slightly kept beard, displaying a quiet intensity. It's the sweet calm before the emotional storm. The passion and immediacy behind Luke's music is evident in his 3 independent releases since February 2009. Emotional and poetic lyrics about the inspirations in his life are sewn together throughout his songs.</p><p>This steady flow of genuine music has increased his visibility and earned him comparisons to such notable acts as Ryan Adams, Joe Purdy, Damien Rice and Ray Lamontagne. Like most emerging musicians, Luke has led several lives - first as a ballplayer and then as a history teacher. But unable to escape the music, Luke started writing down all those 'ghost songs' swirling in his head.</p><p>Luke's captive live shows open the listener's heart and soul to a voice familiar but unique. There is a passion behind Luke's songs that have to be witnessed in person. Occasionally, Luke sings without a microphone in front of sold out audiences because there is no better way to express the feelings of hope, love and loss. Intimate and moving stories revealing a believer chasing his dreams.</p><p>In just a year of live performances, Luke has sold out shows under his belt, performed with David Dondero, Butterfly Boucher, David Mead and Rachel Loy and released his highly anticipated 3rd album, ""Love, Laura and the Bomb"".

There's just something about him that invites you to give up your innermost thoughts. And complete strangers don't hesitate to do so, as he wryly details in ""Oh!""</p><p>Riding the subway with the scent of her hair<br />She took out a toothbrush started using it there<br />She explained ""I'm always sure today's the day I will die<br />I wanna look good if I get to look God in the eye""<br />And I said ""Oh!""</p><p>""Oh"" is one of 10 keenly observed songs from Hutchinson's self-released debut album, Sounds Like This. The CD, which showcases the young singer-songwriter's unique brand of soul, bowed at #1 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart in September 2007. But ""Oh!"" was penned during a dismal period of his life. His deal with Maverick Records had fallen apart when the parent company shuttered the label. With the plug pulled on his nascent recording sessions, Eric hit the road again. ""It was all about getting the exposure and the experience,"" he says. After a relentless touring schedule, Hutchinson, who began writing songs as a child in the DC suburb of Takoma Park, MD, put everything he had into making his album.</p><p>Sounds Like This was released on Hutchinson's own label, Let's Break Records, at the end of August 2007. Overnight it was breaking records - thanks largely to the efforts of a good friend. One of his high school buddies emailed celebrity blogger Perez Hilton a link to Hutchinson's MySpace page. Hilton recommended it on his site and soon, Eric's album was ensconced in iTunes' Top 10 alongside the latest releases from Kanye West and Dave Matthews. It peaked at #5 on the iTunes album chart, becoming the highest-charting album by an unsigned act in iTunes history. No small accomplishment for a record that almost didn't get made.</p><p>A flurry of press followed, including features in Billboard and the Washington Post, which said """"Hutchinson is undeniably charismatic, splitting his time between keyboard and guitar, crooning about stormy romances and everyday struggles.""</p><p>Eric recorded most of Sounds Like This with producer Will Golden (Joe Purdy, Ian Ball) in Los Angeles and two songs with Paul Kolderie (Radiohead) in Boston. ""They were both really open to letting me do my own thing, but at the same time, were there to guide everything,"" he says. ""They didn't involve their egos at all - they just wanted to make music they believed in.""</p><p>Although he's been favorably compared to his early idols (Stevie Wonder, Billy Joel, Paul Simon), one of the most remarkable things about Sounds Like This is the sheer breadth of musical styles Hutchinson effortlessly encompasses. His ease is perhaps inherited from his grandmother, who played viola in a local orchestra, backing everyone from Tony Bennett to Aretha Franklin as they came through town. From the buoyant album opener, ""Ok, It's Alright With Me"" to the thoughtful ""Back to Where I Was,"" depicting two friends at crossroads in their respective lives, to the soulful ""You've Got You,"" the self-described student of pop music fuses divergent styles into a sound he alone owns. Hutchinson's vocals veer from a gritty growl to a shimmering falsetto on ""Outside Villanova,"" which gives way to the jazzy ""Food Chain,"" wherein the narrator comes to terms with a relationship marred by lies and broken expectations.</p><p>Fan favorite ""Rock &amp; Roll"" follows a pair of players rolling their way through the bar scene and ultimately into bed with one another, while its lilting ska-inflected groove erupts into one of Hutchinson's rapid-fire bouts of wordplay. Eric takes pride in the raw, vintage vibe of Sounds Like This. ""I tried really hard to keep it organic,"" he says. ""Music is human expression and what's more human than to make a mistake? So to record something and then take out all the mistakes leaves the project with no soul to it.""</p><p>Hutchinson moved to New York last spring and, eager to tour behind Sounds Like This, began putting together a band. With Jimmy Coleman on drums and Tom Craskey on bass, the trio hit the road in January 2008 with OneRepublic and will be touring non-stop as Eric closes in on his goal of playing each of the 50 states (he's up to 40) and embarks on his first international gigs. And, of course, he will no doubt find inspiration in the inevitable random conversations with total strangers along the way. He's already writing material for the next record. ""I need to be able to road test songs before I feel comfortable putting them on an album,"" says Hutchinson, preparing to burn rubber.</p>",,,,,1244,Cracker (acoustic),http://www.myspace.com/crackerhatesmyspace,http://www.facebook.com/CrackerSoul,http://www.youtube.com/user/crackerrocks,http://www.crackersoul.com/,4144,"<p>Alt-rock icons Cracker have signed with 429 Records and are preparing to unleash a collection of new songs, SUNRISE IN THE LAND OF MILK AND HONEY. Long-time musical co-horts David Lowery and Johnny Hickman have teamed up again with drummer Frank Funaro and bassist Sal Maida and along with stellar producer David Barbe (Drive By Truckers), have created a uniquely eclectic trove of new tunes. Well-worn words used to describe their sound-brash, irreverent, sharp-witted, anthemic and riveting-all descriptives are in full- effect on the new project that bursts with their trademark rock, punk, glam, surf and country aesthetic. Friends John Doe, Patterson Hood and Adam Duritz also make spirited guest turns on SUNRISE...Their 429 Records debut is in- stores on May 5 and the first single to radio is ""Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out With Me"" (add date April 7).</p><p>Taking a new approach to their creative process, SUNRISE IN THE LAND OF MILK AND HONEY is a truly collaborative effort for the band. Suprisingly self-disciplined, the whole band would take time out to write together one week every two months between tours over the course of a year. Focusing on a goal of two songs per day, their individual musical influences combined in refreshing and distinctive ways. On the outside it was a straight-ahead work ethic, but the process resulted in the band clicking creatively with a renewed energy.</p><p>Says Lowery: ""We weren't kicking back on an island in the Caribbean, waiting for the muse to hit us.

This may be due to the fact that she has been performing in indie-rock circuits since she was thirteen.</p><p>After founding the pop/rock trio Lemonface in 2003, the band played nearly 100 shows in their five year span, opening for bands like Flogging Molly, Rooney, The Hush Sound, and Augustana, and performing at such acclaimed clubs as the 9:30 Club, The Recher Theatre, The State Theatre, and The Black Cat. The band also recorded an EP produced by legendary drummer John Molo (John Fogerty, Bruce Hornsby and the Range) and mixed/mastered by Ross Hogarth (Jonas Brothers, Melissa Etheridge), which received airplay on XM's independent station XMU, as well as several college stations.</p><p>Since parting ways with Lemonface in early 2008, Dana has further developed her own material. Influenced by folk, rock, alt-country, and indie, her music reflects these genres while maintaining a strong pop sensibility. She currently attends Berklee College of Music in Boston, where she began collaborations with band members Ryan Harris Brown (Guitar/Vocals), Owen Danoff (Bass/Vocals), Drew Harakal (Piano/Vocals), and Eric Jackowitz (Drums/Vocals).</p><p>Dana's debut release, ""The Evergreen EP"", was produced by Mark Williams and will be released this winter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,1237,Pierre Bensusan,,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c52n2YXwTM,http://www.pierrebensusan.com,0,"<p>If ""World Music"" is music that pays tribute to the spirit of a collection of human beings through distinct rhythms, traditional instruments and harmonic colors, French-Algerian guitarist, singer and composer Pierre Bensusan can be recognized as one of the most eloquent and diverse world musicians of our time.</p><p>Born in Oran, French-Algeria, in 1957, when France was decolonizing its Empire, Pierre Bensusan&lsquo;s family moved to Paris when he was 4. He began formal studies on piano at the age of 7 and at 11 taught himself guitar. Influenced in those early days by the folk revival blooming in Britain, France and North America, Bensusan began first to explore his own diverse musical heritage and then moved to the horizons beyond. At 17 he signed his first recording contract, and one year later his first album Pres de Paris won the Grand Prix du Disque upon his debut at the Montreux Festival in Switzerland. Described by the L.A. Times as ""one of the most unique and brilliant acoustic guitar veterans in the world music scene today"", Pierre Bensusan was voted ""Best World Music Guitar Player in 2008"" by Guitar Player Magazine Readers Choice.</p><p>His name became synonymous with contemporary acoustic guitar genius, long before the terms New Age, New Acoustic Music or World Music were invented. He has the ability to make a single guitar sound like an entire band as he brings the audience on a mesmerizing musical journey. And yet, Bensusan is more than what any musician or music lover expects from a guitarist. He is a composer as well as a bilingual and a brave improvisational vocalist, melding whistles and resonant low notes with something like his own scat technique.</p><p>There is a sense of something both playful and serious in his work, an unparalleled sense of freedom in his compositions and his improvisations. His ""manner"" of playing defies classification - crossing world, classical, jazz, traditional, folk and more. None can be isolated as simply ""Brazilian"", ""Arabic"" or ""French""; rather, they represent our world in its current state, a world sharing itself, fusing cultures together in ways we have never experienced.

Innes, with Vivian Stanshall, wrote most of the band's songs, including ""I'm the Urban Spaceman"", their sole hit, (produced by Paul McCartney and Gus Dudgeon under the collective pseudonym Apollo C. Vermouth) and ""Death Cab for Cutie"" (which inspired an American musical group of the same name), which was featured in the Beatles' film Magical Mystery Tour. Innes won an Ivor Novello Award for Best Novelty Song in 1968 for ""I'm the Urban Spaceman"".<br />In the late 1960s, Innes appeared with the Bonzo Dog Band on both seasons of the UK children's television series Do Not Adjust Your Set which also featured future members of the Monty Python comedy team.</p><p>After the break-up of Bonzo Dog Band, Neil joined with former Dog Band bassist Dennis Cowan, drummer Ian Wallace and guitarist Roger McKew to form The World, a band hoping for ""more commercial"" success with music ranging from rock to pure pop, yet still retaining some Doo-Dah flavour and even a bit of the humour.</p><p><br />In the mid-1970s, Neil became closely associated with the TV series Monty Python's Flying Circus, and played a major role in performing and writing songs and sketches for the final series in 1974 (after John Cleese had left).</p><p>Neil wrote the songs for Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and appeared in the film as a head-bashing monk, the serf crushed by the giant wooden rabbit, and the leader of Sir Robin's minstrels. He also had a small role in Terry Gilliam's Jabberwocky, and performed with the Pythons on stage, including at their legendary Hollywood Bowl concert. Because of these long-standing connections, Neil is often referred to as ""the Seventh Python"".</p><p><br />He appeared on stage with the Pythons in New York City in 1975, performing the Bob Dylanesque song ""Protest Song"" (complete with harmonica) on the album Monty Python Live at City Centre. He was introduced as Raymond Scum. After his introduction he told the audience ""I've suffered for my music. Now it's your turn."" In 1982 he travelled to the States with the Pythons again, appearing in Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl. He performed the songs ""How Sweet to Be an Idiot"" and ""I'm the Urban Spaceman.""</p><p>After Python finished its original run on UK television, Neil joined with Fatso and Python's Eric Idle on the series Rutland Weekend Television. This was a Python-esque sketch show based in a fictional low-budget regional television station. It ran for two series in 1975-76. Songs and sketches from the series appeared on a 1976 BBC LP, the Rutland Weekend Songbook. This show spawned The Rutles (the ""prefab four""), a Beatles parody band, in which Neil played the character of Ron Nasty. Incidentally the very first Rutles track to be recorded was ""I Must Be In Love"" which featured in the Rutland Weekend Television series and performed by Neil Innes and Fatso.</p><p>After Rutland Weekend Television, Idle relocated to the USA, and Neil went on to make a solo series on BBC television, The Innes Book of Records (punning on the Guinness Book of Records). At the time of The Beatles Anthology CDs, there was a revival of interest in The Rutles and a new album was released entitled Archaeology. Neil also took part in the 2002 Concert for George, in memory of George Harrison. A film about Neil Innes called The Seventh Python premiered at the Mods &amp; Rockers Film Festival on June 26, 2008.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://www.neilinnes.org/audio/audio.htm,,,,1232,The Verve Pipe (family show!),,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFlcfKPSlT8,http://www.thevervepipe.com/family/,6112,"<p><strong><a href=""http://www.zooglobble.com"" target=""_blank"">Zooglobble Recommended!</a>: ""'A Family Album' is ten tons of fun.""</strong></p><p>With sales of three million albums worldwide and a reputation for spectacular live performances, the genesis of The Verve Pipe can be traced back to the early 90s, when lead singer Brian Vander Ark and drummer Donny Brown, members of two rival Michigan bands, joined forces.

During his high school years, Victor was actively involved in his home church Youth Ministry while leading worship and founding a youth choir who sang and performed most all works composed and arranged by Victor. After having won many titles in County Wide, District, and State vocal and piano competitions, he continued his education while attending Longwood College for 2 years. He further studied at Oral Roberts University to complete his BA Degree in Music Education with concentrations in both piano and voice.</p><p>As a classically trained pianist and vocalist, Victor began traveling to local churches ministering through music and the spoken word. In 1994, while ministering in various churches, he founded Victor Lopez &amp; Company, a traveling gospel group singing original worship songs composed by Victor. In this same year, he married his high school sweetheart, Rhonda, and further went on to pursue a teaching career while teaching music in both public and private schools. During this season, Victor composed and accumulated many original compositions such as worship tunes, solo works, choir arrangements, and children's music and plays for circulation in local churches. As the demand and popularity of his teaching style and music grew, Victor opened the doors of Lopez Studios, Inc. Performing Arts School (www.lopezstudios.org) in the late 1990's to offer instruction in the performing arts with a special emphasis on character development. Today, Lopez Studios, Inc. stands with over 200 students participating in its programs and has become one of the fastest growing performing arts schools on Northern Virginia.</p><p>After years of requests for his music, Victor began production of an independent album.

The album included the #1 single ""The Freshmen,"" one of the most successful multi- format tracks of 1997 and winner of an ASCAP Pop Award.  Their follow-up release, the critically acclaimed self- titled LP The Verve Pipe, featured ""Hero,"" a Top 15 hit at Modern Rock radio.</p><p>In addition to their success on radio, TV and film, sold-out concert dates throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia, features in Spin and Rolling Stone and videos on MTV and VH1, the band have made numerous television appearances, including ""The Tonight Show With Jay Leno"" and ""Late Night With David Letterman.</p><p>In 2009, the band was approached to submit a new song for a compilation album of children's songs.  That session inspired A Family Album, an original collection of songs intended for the entire family, with fun and inventive lyrics set to the memorable melodies the band is known for.  Recording this album set the groundwork for a new rock LP, to be released in 2010.  The Verve Pipe is currently on tour performing both old favorites as well as music from the new album.</p><p><strong></strong></p>",http://thevervepipe.com/music.html,,,,1216,Jammin Java Presents Todd Wright's 9th Annual Santa Clauster-f@%!Christmas Spectacular (acoustic),http://www.myspace.com/orangepopsongs,http://www.facebook.com/orangepopsongs,http://www.youtube.com/user/orangepopsongs,http://orangepopsongs.com/,12686,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tis the third and the second nights before Christmas <br />When Santa Claus gathers some sixty musicians<br />To play holiday songs without ever rehearsing<br />Making music and magic with minimal cursing<br />And before all this holiday dust starts to settle<br />There'll be polka, folk, rock and the heaviest metal<br />So get tickets now or you'll be out of luck<br />And you won't get to say that you got ""Clauster....""</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/todd-wright/id402515994?uo=4&partnerId=30, ,http://twitter.com/orangepopsongs,,1215,Blackbox Entertainment,,,,,0,,,,,,1211,I Am The Kaleidoscope,http://www.myspace.com/iamthekaleidoscope,,,,4837,,,,,,1210,A Sense of Urgency,http://www.myspace.com/asouva,,,,4048,,http://www.purevolume.com/asenseofurgencyva,,,,1208,New Years Eve Party!,,,,,4456,"<p><strong>With <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/shanehines"" target=""_blank"">Shane Hines (full band!)</a> + <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/blackjacksmusic"" target=""_blank"">The Blackjacks</a> + <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/crashboombang"" target=""_blank"">Crash Boom Bang</a> + <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/billywoodward"" target=""_blank"">Billy Woodward and the Senders</a></strong></p><p>Bring in 2010 in style with the very best bands the DC area has to offer as they host a special, intimate New Years Eve party at Jammin Java.

""That was a really wonderful way to start.  I could present myself exactly as I wanted,"" says Digby, who first started writing her own songs at age 15 on a $50 guitar she bought on a whim. Her first album, Unfold, debuted at #29 on the Billboard chart, # 2 on the iTunes album chart, # 3 on Billboard's Digital Top 100 album chart and prompted a successful string of film and television placements for her songs including ER, Greek, The Hills, One Tree Hill, and Smallville.</p><p>Prior to her YouTube fame and the success of Unfold, Digby was set on a much different course. The first child of a Japanese mother and Irish-American father, the Los Angeles native went off to college at Berkeley where she studied philosophy and figured she'd eventually follow in her dad's footsteps and go to law school.</p><p>So when she came home after finishing her freshman year and promptly announced she was dropping out to become a full-time musician, her parents were understandably baffled. In some ways, Digby surprised herself too. ""I'm not one of those kids who was always in the school musical or was the star of the high school play,"" she says.  ""And even when I tried to get involved, I was often rejected. I figured I must be really bad.""</p><p>Despite the odds, Digby couldn't ignore her inner voice.

Self-produced and titled 'The Heart,' it's a watershed work which sees Jimmy drop his guard and raise the bar. The prevailing mood is one of beautiful melancholy, but 'The Heart' has dignity and integrity in spades. We all have to reckon with loss and the events that have shaped us sooner or later, and this record is Jimmy Gnecco's compelling attempt to do just that. Its elegant, elegiac songs are slow-growers that get right under the skin. It was with shape-shifting alternative rock band Ours that Jimmy first made a name for himself. A dynamic and urgent outfit that would later draw comparisons with Radiohead, they soon caught the attention of various U.S. record companies.</p><p>Jimmy signed to DreamWorks records under the Ours moniker in 1997, and his band's debut album 'Distorted Lullabies' was released in 2001.The critically acclaimed records 'Precious' and 'Mercy' (the latter handled by friend, production genius and long-term Jimmy Gnecco fan Rick Rubin) followed in 2002 and 2008, respectively. Matters beyond Jimmy's control - major label politics, for example - have sometimes slowed his output, but he has always retained his positivity, strong work ethic, and a certain blue-collar mentality, which recognises that respect has to be earned.</p><p>If you've read this far, you will understand why Jimmy Gnecco has been able to pour so much of himself into his first proper solo record, 'The Heart.' Out on Bright Antenna records Summer 2010, it's a sterling achievement; graceful, almost hymnal songs such as ""Mystery"" and ""Take A Chance"" channel a formidable talent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Free Dominguez (of Kidney Thieves)&nbsp;</span> <a href=""http://freedominguez.com/"">official site</a> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/freedominguez"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/FreeDominguez"">facebook <br /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/jimmy-gnecco/id16191161?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/jimmygnecconews,"<iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/KRuXWZiNsb0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",1160,Mercy Mercedes - CANCELLED,,,,,0,,,,,,1157,Push Play,http://www.myspace.com/pushplayrox,http://www.facebook.com/pushplayrox,http://www.youtube.com/pushplayband#p/c/CDAFB4889BE43D45,http://pushplaysite.com/,3993,"<p>The world is rife with next big things, the majority of which come and go in a cloud left behind in hype and false hopes.

From the beginning, they have nurtured each and every voice of passion that acts as the fuel in this constantly expanding fan base which simply borders on phenomenon. Singer CJ Baran shares, ""As a band, we have focused on building a relationship with the fans. One by one, we have prided ourselves in making the time to get to know them, on a personal level whenever possible."" Drummer Derek Ries adds, ""They have been really loyal, and we try to make it a real experience for them. Push Play provides an intimacy in the fan experience from the moment we pull in to town, play the gig, and then interact with every one who came out after the show.

She has also recorded for a number of other labels, in between endless tour schedules that have only recently begun to slow down.</p><p>Along the way, she has won five W.C. Handy Awards (now known simply as Blues Awards) from the Blues Foundation, two for ""Best Traditional Blues Female Artist,"" and three for ""Acoustic Blues Album of the Year,"" the most recent just last year.

And Guitar Extra, a publication that knows what it speaks about, added: ""Rory Block has become one of the world's most important preservers of the roots of American music. She has become a national treasure in the form of an uncompromising mature blues artist.""</p><p>And her peers echo the praise; Bonnie Raitt put it this way: ""Rory has been an inspiration to me since we started out years ago. Her guitar playing, singing and songwriting are some of the most soulful in traditional and modern blues.""</p><p>And Dick Waterman, listening to the test pressings of the new record, summed it up: ""She is a true messenger for the blues; an artist who can bring this music to people - perhaps in the same way that Mr. House brought it to Robert Johnson and countless others.""</p><p>Rory Block's own watchwords are simple: ""Life is short, and fragile, and I know we all have a mission.

But drive they did, and Cowan is still glad of it. ""It's really rather difficult to describe the feeling that creeps up your spine as you stand on the proudly named Fred Shellman stage preparing to perform at Telluride. I always take a deep breath, look out above the crowd, mumble a quick prayer of gratitude, and then hold on for dear life.""</p><p>His new album, 8,745 ft., clearly illustrates why Cowan is a perennial Telluride favorite.

A.W.K. and Calder Quartet had original works commissioned by The Explorers Club, premiered at the Club's renowned annual dinner in New York City.

From the Calder's selections of music for string quartet and electronics by Philip Glass and Christine Southworth, to Andrew's improvisations on themes of Bach, to the final closing numbers from the Andrew W.K. songbook (with certain raucous audience members joining the band onstage), it was a night I will not soon forget and hope to be able to repeat soon."" <em>-Ronen Givony, Wordless Music Series Producer</em></p>",,,,,1139,Winterbloom: Holiday Traditions Rearranged,,,,http://www.winterbloom.com,4047,"<p>Singer-songwriters Antje Duvekot, Anne Heaton, Meg Hutchinson and Natalia Zukerman together present a new holiday album (8-song EP) and live show, tailored for this winter season called ""Winterbloom: Traditions Rearranged.""

Last Clock On The Wall was recorded over 6 days at Old Mill Studios, located in a 17th century mill converted into a live arts theater in Strathaven, just outside of Glasgow. Take My Blanket and Go (2007) was recorded in NYC following a UK tour in 2006, You Can Tell Georgia (2006) was recorded outside of London immediately following a European tour with Tom McRae, while Paris in the Morning (2006) was recorded during a short visit to Paris a few months later. Canyon Joe (2007) was recorded at his home in California, after being stranded in New Mexico during a blizzard over New Years Eve.</p><p>Adding to his arsenal, Purdy has been embraced by a broader audience through Prime Time network television. His song ""Wash Away (Reprise),"" from the Julie Blue album, was chosen by J.J. Abrams for an episode of ABC's smash hit ""Lost"" in its first season. Shortly after, Purdy's song ""I Love the Rain Most"" (also off Julie Blue) was featured in an episode of ABC's ""Grey's Anatomy,"" which led to ""The City"" (Only Four Seasons) being included in the show as well as on the Grey's Anatomy Season I soundtrack which sold over 150,000 units. Additionally, Purdy landed five more songs in ""Grey's"" episodes including ""San Jose"" (Take My Blanket and Go), ""Suitcase"" (Only Four Seasons), ""Can't get it Right Today"" (You Can Tell Georgia), and ""Rainy Day Lament"" (Stomping Grounds), which was featured on an episode of the fox hit ""House."" ""Can't Get It Right Today"" was also featured in a new KIA ad that ran nationally.</p><p>Purdy also has the glowing endorsement of Pete Townsend, who invited him to duet on his ""In The Attic - Pete Townsend and friends"" concert series. The DVD release of this concert series features Townsend and Purdy performing an acoustic version of ""Let My Love Open The Door"" and a touching performance of Joe's song ""Daisy,"" as accompanied by his father Dave Purdy on mandolin.</p>",http://joepurdy.com/music,,,,1135,Lloyd Dobler Effect Holiday Unplugged Show & CD Release,http://www.myspace.com/lloyddoblereffect,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Lloyd-Dobler-Effect/17197462942,http://www.youtube.com/ldebruno,http://www.lloyddoblereffect.com,7203,"<p>Twice a year, the members of Lloyd Dobler Effect get together with Songwriter Elizabeth Coyle, Washington DC Tenor Saxophone legend Albert Ketler and Chris Brooks (pianist from national reggae act Lionize) and perform a special Unplugged Story-Tellers evening.

Thriving on their hybrid fusion of acoustic and electric sounds, luscious counter-melodies and seldom heard five part harmonies, The Influence has established their presence amongst the elite rockers of today.</p><p>The five piece (originating from Virginia Beach) is influenced by the familiar sounds of the great 90s rock movement but is undeniably rooted in late 60s and early 70s rock sensibility. Matthew Archer Stephenson's smokey, Peter Gabriel reminiscent vocals provide a candid look into the harsher, more provocative themes usually locked deep within the vaults of the more tortured minds. Their on stage delivery is pure chaos in its search for perfection. An influence show is pure expulsion usually leaving a stage dismantled and the audience enamored.</p><p>""The Influence shimmers like sun through the thunderclouds!"" <em>-The Washington Post</em></p><p>""It breaks musical boundries. A vacation back to the early nineties. It is post grunge excellence. It is alternative, acoustic, and unsafe. They are wonderful purveyors of melody and lyricism. They prove themselves as a talented entitiy capable of producing great period music and of packaging emotion and alternative rock into one sonically satisfying box to be opened."" <em>-Mace &amp; Crown</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Started in November of 2010, The Good Fight is a 5-piece pop-punk band from Arlington, VA. Consisting of members from many different backgrounds, The Good Fight has a pop punk sound, with heavy breakdowns, catchy leads, and melodic vocals.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">The Good Fight</span> <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/TGFpoppunk?sk=app_178091127385 "" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-influence/id195763141?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/theinfluence,,1132,Graham Colton,,http://www.facebook.com/grahamcolton,http://www.youtube.com/grahamcolton,http://grahamcolton.com,17895,"<p>Self-described songwriter-singer, merging grassroots inspiration with pop-rock accessibility ""As a singer/songwriter, Colton has the writing talents of Chris Carrabba and the musical abilities of Rob Thomas, but he melds the two in a style that differs greatly from Dashboard melodrama and Matchbox Twenty popsadness."" - Fuzz Magazine <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />In many ways Colton HAS been the soundtrack to people's lives. His story is one that aspiring musicians dream of - while playing local coffeehouses, he routinely handed out homemade CDs - one of which found its way onto the internet online tastemakers could provide. The chatter eventually reached one of his biggest influences, Adam Duritz, who asked him to open for the Counting Crows. Colton put a band together, went on tour and scored a label deal. Through sheer hard work and relentless perseverance, Colton went on tour with the likes of John Mayer, Maroon 5, OAR, Dave Matthews Band, Train, The Wallflowers and pop superstar Kelly Clarkson. Along the way he wrote amazing songs, including ""Best Days,"" for the album Here Right Now, which was chosen as ""Song of the Week"" on iTunes, accruing over 700,000 downloads. ""Best Days"" became the exit music for American Idol, was used in a year-end commercial for HBO and was chosen by none other than Oprah Winfrey for her Big Give television specials. Here Right Now debuted at #2 on the Billboard New Artist chart and #4 on the iTunes Pop Chart, and led to Graham being asked to perform on a cavalcade of television shows including Ellen, The Tonight Show, Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, The Late Show with David Letterman, The Today Show and Live! With Regis &amp; Kelly.</p><p>After such heady success, Colton took time to re-group; deciding to get 100% behind his career and go indie again, he holed himself up in his hometown of Oklahoma City to begin to put down the words, ideas and melodies that had been banging around his head. The result is the pop perfect Pacific Coast Eyes. Pacific Coast Eyes is an album Graham Colton is not only proud to share with his fans, but also a collection of songs that will stand the test of time. It is most evident at live shows, where Colton's charisma shines through, providing another avenue for Graham to express his art though his live performances, where packed standing room shows are the norm. Graham's time in the public eye hasn't diminished his passion for what he does, and has only proven that he is a career artist who continues to grow musically with each new release.</p><p><a

""We steer clear of that<br />in arrangements.""</p><p>With a cappella vocal groups proliferating madly on college campuses and infiltrating the mainstream via TV shows like Glee, Sonos couldn't have emerged at a more propitious time. But the three women (Freedman, Bearer and Katharine Hoye) and three men (McLain, Chris Harrison and Paul Peglar) who produce its tapestry of tones are swimming against the tide of jukebox set lists, doo-wop inflections and collegiate shtick in their quest to take a cappella music to a new, more sensual, more musically adventurous destination.</p><p>They've already won plaudits from such tastemakers as Chris Douridas of L.A. bellwether station KCRW-FM, who praised Sonos' ""innovative vocal arrangements"" and ""inspired repertoire, supremely delivered."" ""Prepare to be stunned,"" advised the U.K. newspaper The Guardian, while Campus Circle lauded their ""unaccompanied magnificence."" Beyond admiring the group's sonic achievements, critics also noted its ""sexual tension"" (L.A. tastemaker outlet The Deli Magazine) and ""sex appeal"" (Pasadena Weekly).</p><p>On its debut album, SonoSings, the group combines a rich, classically choral sensibility with an ultra-modern repertoire and sonic toolkit. The result is a<br />spellbinding fusion of ancient and contemporary sounds, as songs by the likes of Radiohead (""Everything in Its Right Place""), Sara Bareilles (an a cappella veteran herself, she joins Sonos for a rendition of her ""Gravity""), Fleet Foxes (""White Winter Hymnal""), Bon Iver (""Re:Stacks""), Rufus Wainwright (""Oh What a World""), Bj&ouml;rk (""Joga""), Imogen Heap (""Come Here Boy"") and other cutting-edge creators are transformed into mesmerizing vehicles for voices only.</p><p>The only pre-existing pop megahit in the batch is ""I Want You Back,"" but the group's moody, trip-hop rendition radically re-imagines the tune - bringing<br />out the dark, despairing lyrics that were all but negated by the Jackson 5's bouncy, bubblegum original. With the passing of Michael Jackson, the version serves as an emotional homage.</p><p>Harrison produced and mixed the disc (with Gabriel Mann and manager Hugo Vereker, who assembled the group, provided A&amp;R direction on the album and dreamed up the stark reworking of ""I Want You Back""); he also handled several arrangements.</p><p>""Chris is a freakin' genius arranger,"" enthuses Freedman, ""but we all have experience arranging and writing music, and we bring so many diverse backgrounds to the table that we're greater than the sum of our parts."" Indeed, Freedman, Bearer and Hoye all contributed sterling arrangements to SonoSings. Agrees McLain, ""If any of us weren't what we are, Sonos wouldn't be Sonos.""</p><p>Performing ""I Want You Back"" and other songs live, Sonos further pushes the envelope with the judicious use of effects pedals, guided by resident ""gearhead"" Harrison. McLain, in addition to singing leads and harmonies, contributes beatboxing that's looped into a panoply of polyrhythms. (He developed the latter skill while lying in bed in his small-town California home, listening to hip-hop station KMEL-FM; his first cassette, he volunteers, was Very Necessary by Salt-N-Pepa.) But that's just the tip of the technological iceberg.</p><p>""We're very comfortable performing purely acoustically,"" explains Englandborn, L.A.-bred Hoye, who attended the famed Berklee School of Music before heading to UCLA, where she met her future co-harmonizers. ""But in the studio and playing live with a sound system, we essentially make electronic vocal music. We think of our collection of pedals and loops as the seventh member of the group.""</p><p>""When we sing &lsquo;I Want You Back,' I use an octave pedal,"" she adds, referring to a device that splits notes played or sung into two tones an octave apart. ""That way, I get to fulfill my fantasy, as an alto, of singing bass. You can hear a bass part, but I'm the only one singing. It confuses people.""</p><p>That said, the electronics are a small part of the picture - the Sonos experience is first and foremost about how ""You can go from nothing to something just by opening your mouth,"" as Cleveland-born Cali transplant Peglar - whose stratospheric range is variously described as ""rock tenor"" and ""ballsy falsetto"" by his compatriots, and who's been spotted playing keyboards on the aforementioned TV series Glee - puts it.</p><p>Like almost everything else about the group, its origin and development have been unconventional. ""We sort of became a band backwards,"" explains elder statesman Harrison. ""We formed, rehearsed, made a record and then started performing live.""</p><p>The San Diego native - who grew up watching his dad playing in bluegrass bands - sang in the famed UCLA vocal ensemble known as Awaken A Cappella with Bareilles and fellow future Sonos members Freedman (who comes from Santa Rosa, Calif.) and Peglar. The latter two had attended high school in Santa Rosa with McLain.</p><p>Bearer - who grew up singing opera in Tulsa, Okla. (""the buckle of the Bible Belt"") - had been kept from pop music by her musical-purist parents, but says singing a cappella changed her life completely. She attended both UCLA and USC, and was a member of celebrated a cappella ensemble SoCal Vocals when she met Harrison, who invited her to audition for the group; after a mere five rehearsals, she flew to New York for a performance.</p><p>Rather than bang out the record over a few months, Sonos took its sweet time. ""We recorded the Radiohead track nearly three years ago, and we added two new tracks the day before it was mastered,"" Freedman reveals. ""It spans our entire evolution as a group. We've really grown into our own sound and style.""</p><p>They performed their first gig at the Santa Rosa high school Freedman, McLain and Peglar had attended together. While their vocal mix clearly delighted the crowd, Peglar recalls, their visual presentation hadn't yet evolved. ""I watched a video of it and promptly deleted it,"" he relates, ""because it was not what we wanted to present to people."" Some seven months passed before their next show, however, and the group soon developed its signature presentational style - sleek, sexy and confrontational, with an air of mystery not often found in the a cappella world.</p><p>Perhaps the ensemble's most revelatory live moment thus far came in the gorgeously austere confines of a 17th Century London church, where they sang for an audience of fans, friends and industry folk. Performing ""White Winter Hymnal"" and ""Gravity,"" particularly, in such a setting, Peglar remembers, ""Was kind of a checkpoint, because it was the six of us and the audience, with nothing in the way. I'd never even been overseas, so just being in London was amazing; compounding that was making music with my friends in this incredible church.""</p><p>""There's something organic and mysterious about singing a cappella,"" Peglar continues. ""It's beautiful and intangible. It could've been centuries earlier with a piece of classical music, but we're taking something from last year and making it just as haunting and interesting. I think that's what's most captivating about us."" Manager Vereker reports that the music-business types in attendance were stunned. ""Almost every one of them came up to me afterward,"" he says, ""and told me they'd never seen anything like it in their lives.""</p><p>With its debut album complete at last, the group is prepared to bring its oneof-a-kind vocal blend to the world - and plans to pepper its tour schedule with venues like performing-arts centers, colleges and even living rooms. But whether they're in a courtyard, a club or a concert hall, Sonos will always seek that intangible, mysterious, intimate fusion of timeless tones and modern meaning - with nary a ""dow"" to be heard.</p>",http://www.imeem.com/sonosings,,,,1128,Honeychuck CD Release,http://www.myspace.com/honeychuck,,,http://www.honeychuck.com,0,"<p>Honeychuck rocks pretty hard for a band with a girl and an acoustic guitar in it. A four-piece alternative rock band hailing from Washington, DC, Honeychuck is full of a contagious energy every time they hit the stage, and they're blowing away audiences one venue at a time. The talent, experience, and sheer determination of all four members create a sound and personality bred from honest songwriting and captivating performances. Since their creation in 2002, Honeychuck has evolved into a dynamic alternative rock band, tapping into their roots (from blues to metal, from folk to grunge) and impressing everyone along the way.</p><p>With their album ""It's Not You, It's Me,"" Honeychuck has made a statement from coast to coast; the band spent two weeks on a tour of the Southwest, stomping their way into the southern California and Arizona music scenes. Mixed by Brooklyn, NY's Tim Donovan (Lisa Loeb, Erykah Badu, 310), the four soaring tracks leave listeners both satisfied and wanting more. ""It's Not You, It's Me"" captures the essence of the band's sound, highlighting Debra Guy's aggressive yet pure voice, the tastefully blazing guitar work of T.Wesley, combined with the rock-solid rhythm section of Ben Pettit and Sam Murray.</p><p>Boasting over a decade of combined musical experience, the members of Honeychuck have received some long overdue credit, recently playing Washington DC's 9:30 Club, as well as headlining Falls Church, Virginia's State Theatre with their electric and gratifying live show. 2010 will ring in Honeychuck's follow-up record, raising the bar even higher and picking up right where they left off. The band's on-stage and musical chemistry is evident in every show they play, and every new song they write. Honeychuck provides clarity, reminding listeners of everything the love about music, tapping into familiarities and pushing the envelope all at the same time.</p>",,,,,1126,Andrew Hoover,,,,,0,,,,,,1125,Ernie Halter + Mutlu,http://www.myspace.com/erniehalter,,,http://www.rockridgemusic.com/artists/erniehalter,6201,"<p>Singer-songwriter Ernie Halter went through an emotional roller coaster this year.</p><p>""The new record is called &lsquo;Starting Over' for a reason,"" says Halter. ""I wanted the title to be direct, simple, and set the tone for the album. In this past year, I experienced the ending of a marriage and the birth of my first son. It was during this year that I wrote the material for the new record and performed over 150 shows.""</p><p>""More than ever I think it's important to be as open and honest as possible, both as a songwriter and as a person,"" Halter continues. ""One positive side to the tumultuous year I've had is this new-found freedom to say it as it is, to admit who I am and where I've been. I feel this is a total crossroads for me.""</p><p>""Starting Over"" was recorded in early 2008 in New York City and is the follow-up to 2007's ""Congress Hotel."" ..ing Over"", Halter puts himself out there in deeply personal ways like never before.  Says Halter:  ""I feel like I've started to become a real songwriter in the last year through these experiences and the acknowledgment that it's universal. I'm not the only person who has been in a situation like this, who's been hurt, who's hurt other people.""</p><p>On the eleven-track new album, Ernie mixes blue-eyed soul, pop, and rock in a style that is both familiar, unique and always inimitably Halter. His vocal delivery is percussive and smooth, raw and real, his phrasing often an instrument itself.  From ""Different Lives"" to ""Try"" (a song co-written with tour mate Josh Hoge about balancing a life at home with a life on the road), to the plaintive, piano-driven ballad ""Lighthouse"" (""a song about friends who love you unconditionally""), Halter explores real life in ways he hopes will resonate with his listeners. But there's also a lighter side to the record which reflects Halter beginning to find love again. From the soulful drive of ""Blue Dress"" to the calypso-esque ""Crazy Love"" (""a song about that intoxicated feeling you get from new love, even though your friends think you're nuts""), to ""My Heart is With You"" and ""Count The Days"" (both written about a long distance love affair), the album dips and soars, alternating between heavy topics and light.</p><p>The entire recording process, for perhaps the first time ever, was broadcast over the internet from their New York City studio. Says Halter:  ""To my knowledge, nobody has ever done that."" Halter has been called a pioneer by many including EQ Magazine and text broadcasting company Mozes (Halter was one of its first artists) for his technologically-oriented approach to connecting with fans. Halter elaborates: ""I am making this record for me and them, and I wanted them to see their record being made.  I wanted them to be as much a part of the process as possible. They allow me to do what I do and I think it's extremely important to acknowledge that."" It was actually Halter's tech-savvy approach to promoting and marketing his music that garnered the attention of his management and label, Rock Ridge Music, in the first place:  Halter was one of the first artists to really take advantage of MySpace as a promotional tool.  Utilizing his tech know-how and his extraordinarily focused work ethic, Halter has incorporated such unique features on the page as a live ""tour van cam"" and nightly webcasts of his concerts across the United States.</p><p>Stylistically, Halter endeavored to make ""Starting Over"" sound more organic and a little less polished than previous recordings. Halter's long-time drummer Michael Peters and bassist Zack Rudulph flew out from Halter's hometown of Los Angeles to record with him. Jason Spiewak (Five.Bolt.Main, Chris Volz) sat in the production seat.  ""I wanted this to sound more raw and live.  I tour so much that when it comes to making a record, something tends to gets lost a little when I get into the studio. That is part of the reason why I enjoyed webcasting the sessions so much is because it was the closest thing to bringing that live element into the studio.  Fans were commenting on things we were doing and it was very interactive, more like a live show would be.  One thing that shaped the record sound-wise more than anything was a decision that we made to lay vocals down in the control room with the monitors on. It means that any bleed-through that comes through the mic makes it impossible to edit the vocal in any way.  The vocals were all one straight take.  No editing, no pitch correcting, which is a bit unorthodox. I wanted to be a little bit free to make some mistakes, to let it be what it is, because I feel that is also fitting with the content of the record itself.""</p><p>Halter also has an ongoing cover video series on YouTube.com (http://www.youtube.com/erniehalter), popular with his fans who submit requests on an ongoing basis. It was this, as much as Halter's penchant for performing covers during his live shows, that prompted him to include three covers on the album:  ""Just Friends"" (Musiq Soulchild), ""Pretty Girl"" (David Ryan Harris - a song that Halter wishes he had written himself and calls it ""the most beautiful song ever""), and ""Cyclone"" (Baby Bash).  Halter explains: ""&lsquo;Cyclone' is a hip-hop song, you hear it in clubs, and it's not the kind of song you'd hear an acoustic songwriter singing.  I basically flipped it - added some chords and arrangements that weren't there, rather than just trying to copy it. There's no skill in that. Incidentally, I noticed it was getting a lot of traffic on YouTube.  One night, I was looking on MySpace and Baby Bash had written me a message there just to tell me he dug it. And I found out later that a radio station in Phoenix had picked up the song and had put it in rotation.  People were telling me they heard it on the radio.  I just decided have some fun with it."" <br /> <br />Despite an emotionally-grueling year, Halter finds himself happy to be starting over.  ""Happiness doesn't come from the outside. It has to come from your own acceptance of the present moment.  I feel, in a strange way, more at peace for having gone through everything because it has helped me learn some things and understand some things that I needed to learn.""  And he's equally pleased to be sharing this with his ever-growing fanbase. ""Music is a conversation between the writer/singer and the listener.  I write music for myself, and also for others, so that someone might come up to me in a club after a show and tell me that I'm singing about their life. Call it a distraction or a remedy or catharsis, but there is something very healing about music. Whether you're making or listening to it, it has a way of washing over you, making things alright.""</p>",,,,,1114,An Evening with John Jorgenson Trio,,,http://www.youtube.com/channel/HCfDc89fcl_L0/videos,http://www.johnjorgenson.com,17359,"<p>John Jorgenson is a founding member of the Desert Rose Band, the Hellecasters, and six-year member of Elton John's band. Artists ranging from Barbra Streisand to Bonnie Raitt to Earl Scruggs have sought out Jorgenson's guitar work. Recently, John Jorgenson was chosen to portray Django Reinhardt in the feature film Head in the Clouds. In 1994 Elton John called and invited John on an 18-month world tour. The 18 months stretched into a six-year period that included not only sold out world tours, but also recordings, television appearances, and collaborations with many other artists including Sting and Billy Joel. In additiona to acoustic and electric guitars, John was also featured on saxophone, pedal steel, mandolin and vocals.</p><p>Although John Jorgenson is well-renowned in the pop, country and rock world, gypsy jazz is the style of music closest to his heart. Because of his international reputation as a gypsy jazz player, John was twice asked to recreate Django Reinhardt's music for feature films, Gattica and Head in The Clouds. The latter, released in early 2005 and starring Charlize Theron and Penelope Cruz, features John on camera as Django Reinhardt, complete with burned hand and gypsy moustache. Currently living in Nashville, John tours worldwide playing gypsy jazz with The John Jorgenson Quintet.  He also performs in the UK with his electric band, John Jorgenson &amp; Friends, and continues to collaborate with other artists live and in the studio.</p><p><em></em></p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/john-jorgenson-quintet/id269897821?uo=4&partnerId=30,,,,1113,Harper Simon,http://www.myspace.com/harpersimon,,,,3719,"<p>With a steel guitar and a microphone<br />I hope that you will find your way<br />Someday you'll find out who you are<br />Someday you'll be more than just a shooting star</p><p>-- ""Shooting Star"" by Harper Simon</p><p>Give a listen to Harper Simon's shining solo debut and you'll soon recognize that he is much more than just a shooting star. Harper Simon is the work of an exceptionally gifted singer-songwriter and guitarist who's clearly discovered who he is and found his own way and as a recording artist in a time when the very concept of recording an album seems threatened. Simon artfully shares that sense of discovery here throughout an ambitious and deeply felt new piece of work that offers a vivid and even haunting reminder of how much an album can still mean here in 2009.</p><p>For Harper Simon, the opportunity to make his own album here was a matter of no small consequence. ""The long playing album is the great artistic medium invented in the second half of the 20th century,"" says Simon. ""The long playing album is not just ten songs thrown together randomly. It has an arc. It has a structure. It is the attempt to make ten songs that are all as good as each other, and fit together in a seamless whole. Long playing albums like Sgt Peppers, Bridge Over Troubled Water, Pet Sounds, Blonde On Blonde, Sticky Fingers -- these albums have helped define our culture. When I was making this record, I was very conscious of making a record that was an homage to the LP.""</p><p>Right from the album's opening reworking of a traditional gospel in ""All To God"" through the album's exquisitely romantic closing song ""Berkeley Girl,"" Harper Simon represents a seamless yet wide-ranging whole. This is also a profoundly musical and poetic song cycle that reflects a deep love and abiding respect for the musical traditions of the past, yet one that nonetheless seems very much about making great music in the present tense.</p><p>Simon recorded his new album in Nashville, New York and Los Angeles with the help of an altogether impressive and decidedly eclectic and multi-generational group of musical collaborators, including famed producer Bob Johnston, an all-star group of veteran first-call Nashville session players, an impressive group of contemporary young singer-songwriters and friends, and yes, even Harper's own father, the legendary Paul Simon.</p><p>Howdy<br />I'm gonna tell you a story<br />Most of it is true<br />It goes back to my early memory<br />And maybe it will show you<br />Why I do the things I do<br />I was born in New York City<br />But my mom's from Tennessee</p><p>-- ""Tennessee"" by Harper Simon and Paul Simon</p><p>Making Harper Simon ended up being a journey in its own right. Simon started the long and searching recording process for Harper Simon in Nashville, cutting basic tracks with Johnston - who was behind the board for classic recordings from Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash and Leonard Cohen - backed by a Who's Who of enduring session greats familiar from countless classics of the Sixties and Seventies, including the likes of Charlie McCoy, Lloyd Green and Hargus ""Pig"" Robbins. ""I was also very honored and thrilled and moved beyond words to be able to work with some of the people whose work was featured on some of the best albums of all time,"" explains Simon. ""People who I had been listening to my whole life and whose names I knew only from liner notes and production credits."" ""Working with Bob Johnston and all those Nashville session guys from the 60's was completely fascinating and totally satisfying,"" says Simon. ""Having Lloyd Green at my disposal, the pedal steel player from The Byrds' Sweetheart Of The Rodeo LP. I can't tell you how much acid I dropped to that album. Charlie McCoy, Pig Robbins... holy shit. Blonde On Blonde, Nashville Skyline... whoa. I got to work with Al Perkins whose name I knew from Exile On Main Street. Although actually he's not on the album, he's on a bonus track. Gene Chrisman played drums on Aretha's ""Natural Woman""... Mike Leech and Gene were ELVIS's rhythm section. Their musicianship was extraordinary, their attitude towards me was so supportive... it was very special.""</p><p>In search of a sound that satisfied him, Harper decided to take those basic tracks that he recorded in Nashville to Los Angeles and eventually to New York, and gradually brought in other great players associated with other eras, including a whole new generation of wildly talented musical friends into the mix including Inara George, Petra Haden and Sean Lennon, ultimately mixing the results with Tom Rothrock, know for his work with artists like Beck and Elliot Smith, who all helped bring the shock of the new. Sure, it may have taken a village, but the result reflects one man's wide-ranging sensibility and influences perfectly.</p><p>""The people that came together to contribute to this album are a totally bizarre and wonderful collection of people that will never come together again,"" Harper explains. ""There are players that represent every era of Rock n Roll from the 50s, 60's, 70's... every decade up until now really. People like Bob Johnston and my Dad and the Nashville A Team, these people started making records in the 50's. Then they made some of the most groundbreaking records of the 60's. There are folks like Steve Gadd and Steve Nieve who played on great records in the seventies... Marc Ribot in the 80's... And many others from today like Inara George, Eleni Mandell, Sean Lennon and Adam Green to name just a few. I always wanted to blend these great session players from the 60's with my friends and contemporaries... that was always part of the concept. I think I may have gotten carried away, but it sure was fun.""</p><p>Everyone seems so certain<br />Everyone knows who they are<br />Everyone's got a mother and a father<br />They all seem so sure they're going far<br />They all got more friends than they can use</p><p>Except me &lsquo;cause I'm a fool<br />I'm simple as a bee<br />As a melody in C<br />But it don't matter<br />There are more wishes than stars</p><p>-- ""Wishes And Stars"" by Harper Simon and Ben Okri</p><p>An album marked by an accessible intelligence and unusual musical range, Harper Simon may not be ""simple as a bee/As a melody in C."" Rather this is a musical statement of considerable musical ambition that provides the perfect foundation for the emergence of one compelling new musical voice. Indeed, for all the crucial musical support he received from so many great musicians, Simon himself is everywhere here. He sings most of the gorgeous and evocative harmonies on the album, as well as playing the majority of the stunning guitar parts as well as co-arranging both the memorable string and horn arrangements that bring such unforgettable shading of musical colors to the album.</p><p>In the end, it's clear that there is real blood on these tracks, to borrow a phrase from another iconic songwriter who's not Simon's father, and let there be no doubt that blood is Harper Simon's. Finally, this is an album that reflects powerfully the long road to get to the point where Simon was ready to stake his musical claim. The Harper Simon that emerges here as a significant new artist with talent to burn and a real seriousness of purpose understands full well that ""there really are more wishes than stars"" -- to steal a typically eloquent phrase from another standout song Simon wrote with acclaimed novelist Ben Okri. And so he has taken the time and care to make an album built to last. And this is only really the beginning.</p>",,,,,1104,John Nolan,,,,,0,,,,,,1103,Person L,http://www.myspace.com/personl,,,,3689,"<p>Person L is the brainchild of the incomparable, Kenneth Vasoli. Vasoli, 23, has spent the better part of the past decade building quite a name for himself as the singer and songwriter of the Starting Line. With a career that most would view as a stunning success - selling over 700k records worldwide, sold out tours spanning 4 continents, major label backing - Vasoli was simply not fulfilled in the melodic punk world that the band helped establish. He became enthralled by different musical genres, building an eclectic horizon that slowly brought him to the realization that it was time for him to leave all he had known and make a change.</p><p>Drawing inspiration from artists such as Drive like Jehu, Animal Collective, James Brown, and Radiohead, Person L was formed in the winter of 2006. He recruited a band with the utmost premier players from the area, including members of The Minor Times, Inkling, The Prize Fight and The Suicide Pact. Vasoli had finally found his vessel for musical escape...and a newfound passion for writing songs that pushed the envelope. Initial, the band's debut, is the record that not only pushes that envelope - it licks and seals it. It charters new territory for both Vasoli and listeners alike, and is the evolution of a songwriter who continues to raise the bar with each song he writes.</p><p>Initial will be released on August 5th, 2008 through Vasoli's own imprint, Human Interest. With previous label experiences leaving something to be desired, Vasoli decided to take the DIY mentality and do something with a much larger purpose.

Sort of. Brothers Isaac and Thorald Koren, musicians who, along with drummer Shakerleg, make up New York City band The Kin, were looking to rob ears, not wallets. ""Ladies and gentlemen, this is a musical robbery!"" shouted Isaac as he strode in with Thorald on his heels strumming a guitar. The duo launched into an original song, ""Downtown Train,"" for the restaurant's patrons, winning them over with their energetic performance, rich harmonies, and sheer nerve. By the end, the Korens had the restaurant's unsuspecting patrons whistling and clapping along - no easy feat as anyone who's ridden a NYC subway and tried to ignore a spectacle unfolding in front of them knows.<br /> <br />The Kin have launched several of these ""musical robberies"" over the last year, including at the Sundance Film Festival, SXSW, Soho House in Los Angeles, and even at a French airport.

So transformative are their live performances (one of which has been recorded and released as the CD/DVD Live At Rockwood Music Hall) that Interscope Records A&amp;R executive Barry Williams courted them for two years, eventually dragging his colleague James Mormile to a show at The Stronghold in Venice, CA. Two weeks later, Mormile attended a show at Rockwood and witnessed people in the crowd watching The Kin with their mouths hanging open in amazement. Interscope signed the band shortly after.<br /> <br />The Kin are currently capturing their impassioned delivery and gritty pop-rock sound in the studio, working with legendary producer Tony Visconti (best known for his work with David Bowie and T.Rex), as well as former Record Plant staff engineer Jack Douglas (John Lennon, Aerosmith) and Nic Hard (Joey Ramone, The Church) to record the songs that will make up the band's major-label debut album to be released by Interscope later this year. (Pre-Shakerleg, The Kin released two albums, 2007's Rise and Fall and 2009's THE Upside, independently.) ""The question becomes how do you bring to life something that is so explosive live,"" Thorald says. ""It's like taking a picture of a full moon. It's so big, how do you get it all in the frame?"" <br /> <br />One way has been to showcase not only Isaac and Thorald's dual lead vocals and familial harmonies, but also the raw power of Shakerleg's stick-free, bare-knuckle percussive stylings, which the Buffalo, NY, native honed through years of trying to get the attention of apathetic commuters while performing on NYC subway platforms before he agreed to join native Australians Isaac and Thorald in The Kin. ""Tony really put a magnifying glass on Shakerleg's sound, as well as on the guitar and bass, and encouraged the right vocal attitudes,"" Isaac says. ""We've always wanted our albums to feel like what we'd hope to feel if we sat in the audience ourselves and felt the energy coming from the stage. Tony knows how to hear the pieces of a sound as it's forming. You can hear it in the work he's done with Bowie and T.Rex - just that raw moment when something new is being created."" <br /> <br />The Kin's first shot across the bow is the single ""Gemstone,"" a rollicking tune about a young girl ""who is swallowed up and loses her innocence to the world in every way,"" Isaac says. Another highlight is the love song ""Miracle,"" which Thorald says is about ""when you meet someone and everything gets turned around in 24 hours. You haven't called people back and it's been four days. You're just undone. We use our stories to tell the stories of others,"" he adds of the band's lyrics. ""We use both lenses."" Says Isaac: ""The songs are stories about being human - about transformation."" <br /> <br />That The Kin are drawn to telling such tales feels authentic given that each band member's life has been personally altered by discovering music. For Thorald, inspiration struck at age 11 when he saw a teacher's daughter play the guitar. ""It was never about listening to records, it was all about playing and realizing it was a haven - an escape,"" he says. ""It was also the first time I realized that something I did could have an effect on someone."" Isaac got the bug when a high school friend asked him to join his band. ""Seeing 250 kids jumping up and down, it was this feeling of freedom,"" he says. ""I started teaching myself how to play piano and write lyrics. It was hard because so much has been done before but you try to reach into your own heart and hear the music in there. That's the place I like to write from."" <br /> <br />Shakerleg began playing drums in junior high but got derailed at age 17 when he saw a video of Buddy Rich. ""I started crying while I was watching it,"" he says. ""Like, &lsquo;This guy is so good, I'll never get there,' so I moved to New York to become an actor. When that didn't pan out, I took a job driving hookers around."" Not surprisingly, Shakerleg did not have a future as a chauffeur. Needing a way to make cash, he took his hand drum into the subway and was soon earning $300 dollars a day, a fact he apprised the Koren brothers of when they approached him about joining the band. ""We had to figure out a way to pay him the first year,"" Isaac recalls with a chuckle. ""But I don't think we truly became The Kin until Shakerleg joined. For the six years before that, we played with great musicians but it always felt like we were putting together an ensemble. Whereas now it feels like we're a unit. He's helped us make sense of being a band, of being The Kin.""<br /> <br />This year, The Kin will continue to play live as they finish up recording their upcoming album with Visconti, Douglas, and Hard. ""I like the idea of peeling back the layers and sharing our experiences in such a way that everyone in the room becomes ignited themselves,"" Thorald says. ""To inspire people to express themselves back is absolutely our mission.""</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fthe-kin%252Fid111187271%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/thekin,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/do6iiQwz_4U"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",1089,Jane Siberry (Issa),http://www.myspace.com/issalight,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Issa-light/8899094959,,http://www.issalight.com,4286,"<p>""...applause, cheers and two standing ovations."" <em>-Victoria Times</em></p><p>""A gem...with a fearless simplicity."" <em>-Rolling Stone</em></p><p>""...one of those rare, enigmatic talents whose path is completely her own."" <em>-The Seattle Rocket</em></p><p>In 2006, Issa let go of the name &lsquo;Jane Siberry'. She also let go of her home and most of her possessions and began a new journey of ""living her to-do list."" She described the impetus as ""change or die, do you know what I mean?""</p><p>Issa spent two years writing and recording in Belgium, England, Australia, the United States and Canada. The result is a collections of songs that will be released on three separate CDs telling a &lsquo;Scherezadian' story that will come to an end on the third installment.<br />The first part, Dragon Dreams, was released in November, 2008. The second part, With What Shall I Keep Warm? will be released November, 2009.</p><p>With songs about canoes trips, trains and marriage proposals, Issa describes the first CD Dragon Dreams, as the ""welcome sign and front door"" of the trilogy. The new release, With What Shall I Keep Warm?, invites the listener into Issa's ""living room"" where the conversation takes some unexpected turns. From &lsquo;Eden (Can't Get This Body Thing Right)' to &lsquo;Then We Heard a Shout,' the songs are portraits of the human condition in its glorious mystery. The CD also includes two long-requested favorites from her time as Jane Siberry, &lsquo;In My Dream' and &lsquo;Walk On Water.'</p><p>Continuing in her role as a self-produced artist, Issa is joined by her musical friends in telling the stories. They include John MacArthur Ellis (Canadian producer, guitar/pedal steel); &lsquo;Betty' (Issa's fierce NYC girlfriends); Marlon Saunders, Leslie Alexander, Catherine Russell, Gyan and Gail Ann Dorsey on vocals; Rich Brown on bass; Christine Kim, Pauline Kim and James Roe on strings and oboe - to name a few.</p><p>In an unsettled and unsettling world, Issa continues to re-think her role within it as a musician. This has created an odd assortment of achievements. Of particular note is her online store, Sheeba, which has been a curiosity in the music industry since 2006. Customers have a choice of market price, 'self-determined' pricing, or pay-it-forward (gift from artist).</p>",,,,,1086,Rock The Red Kettle Tour: Honor

Coy,http://www.myspace.com/chasecoy,http://www.facebook.com/chasecoy,http://www.youtube.com/chasecoy,,8700,"<p>Three years ago, Chase Coy began writing and recording music in his basement in Greenwood, Indiana.	While it started as a personal attempt to help him make sense of his life, as Chase shared his music he found that he was not alone. Over 17 million MySpace plays later, his relatable songwriting and genuine connection with his fan base continue to make him one of the most popular unsigned artists in the U.S.</p><p>In 2008, iTunes named Chase one of the best new singer/songwriters of the year. Since then, he has continuously been on the iTunes top 100 singer/songwriter chart alongside classic artists such as Bob Dylan, Simon &amp; Garfunkel and Nick Drake and great new artists such as William Fitzsimmons, The Weepies and Brett Dennen. Recently, Chase's song ""If the Moon Fell Down Tonight"" was featured on an iTunes Essentials Rising Stars compilation.</p><p>If you ask Chase, he might say that he's just a kid from the Midwest who makes music. However, at 18, he is anything but average. He writes beautiful melodies and more honest lyrics than many today are willing to write.	To date, he has released one full-length CD (Look How Far We've Come) and three EPs (Dear Juliet, Goodbyes and Autumn Skies and December), selling more downloads than many of his contemporaries who are signed to recording contracts.</p><p>Chase is now recording his first studio album which will be released in 2010 on a major label to be announced.	Additionally, Chase will tour extensively this fall and winter bringing his music live to the large fan base he has developed across the U.S. and the world.</p>",,,,,1082,Hullabaloo Band,,,http://www.youtube.com/user/hullabaloosteve,http://www.hullabalooband.com,3609,"<p>Hullabaloo is farm-fresh, free-range, organic kid-folk in a genre filled with musical Twinkies and Ding-Dongs. Don't get us wrong (and please don't sue us Hostess Foods Inc.), Twinkies and Ding-Dongs are great (in small doses). But, after a while, you need something with a little more substance-something that won't induce an insulin coma.</p><p>Here at Hullabaloo World Headquarters (the back corner of Steve's mom's garage), we like to say ""We're putting the music back in kid's music!"" because, until recently, it's been a pretty sad state of affairs. A lot of parents raised on rock'n'roll have a hard time down-shifting to singing dinosaurs and hamsters and, frankly, we don't blame them.</p><p>We're proud to be part of a growing number of artists that have found a way to honor and entertain kids without making their parents want to jump out of a moving mini-van.</p><p>Steve's a folksinger and a songwriter and Brendan is a long-time rock'n'roll drummer so, you'll hear traces of twang, funk, rock, folk and blues in our songs. We play the time-tested favorites we all grew up with and we write songs that make kids laugh, think, sing, dance, clap and stomp their feet.</p><p>2006- Parents' Choice Award for ""Sing Along With Sam""</p><p>2007- Parents' Choice Award for ""Hey, Everybody!""</p><p>2007- Childrens Music Web Award for ""Hey, Everybody!""</p><p>2008- NAPPA Gold Award for ""Tall as a Tree""</p><p>2008- Parents' Choice Award for ""Tall as a Tree""</p><p>2008- Children's Music Web Award for ""Tall as a Tree""</p>",,,,,1080,Family of the Year,http://www.myspace.com/familyoftheyear,http://www.facebook.com/familyoftheyear,,http://familyoftheyear.net,3678,,,,,,1078,BetaRaz Presents: Powerhouse,http://www.myspace.com/farazb36,,,,3600,"<p>Doors at 9pm.</p><p>ALL AGES - 21 to drink.</p><p><strong>Hosted by K-Beta with Live Performances by:</strong></p><p>Teflon</p><p>Rated R</p><p>G Hector</p><p>F.A.T.</p><p>Prince ""M-City's Finest""</p><p>The D</p><p>Tone Capone</p><p>Troof</p><p><strong>Atmosphere by DJ RBI</strong></p>",,,,,1073,YOU ARE NOT ALONE TOUR: HAWTHORNE HEIGHTS,http://www.myspace.com/hawthorneheights,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hawthorne-Heights/8443968826,http://www.youtube.com/user/HawthorneHeightsVids,http://www.hawthorneheights.com/,0,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ATTN: YOU ARE NOT ALONE 2011</strong></p><p>Dear Hawthorne Heights Fans and Supporters,</p><p>It is with great pleasure, that we offer you a simple tour announcement.

The band was  one of the first visionary acts to embrace social networking as a  powerful tool in building an audience, and, to this day, continues to  maintain a level of accessibility to the fans via these platforms.   Their debut album, The Silence In Black And White, was certified  platinum for sales of 1,000,000 copies by the RIAA.  The follow-up, If  Only You Were Lonely, had an impressive debut at #3 on the Billboard 200  in 2006, going on to sell over a half-million copies and receiving gold  certification. Hawthorne Heights recorded a third, and final album, for  Victory Records in August 2008 titled Fragile Future.  The band signed  to Wind-up in February 2009.</p><p>As the voice of a genre, the band became regulars on MTV, their  signature hit Ohio Is For Lovers the anthem for the new wave of ""emo"".   The band appeared on Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Kimmel, and became magazine  cover stars, sending sales of The Silence... to Platinum status.</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/hawthorne-heights/id92149634?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/HawthorneHgts,,1071,Betaraz Entertainment Presents: VA Strong,http://www.myspace.com/farazb36,,,,3573,"<p><strong>Performing Live:</strong><br />Jah-I-Witness<br />Kinetic<br />Tony Moon<br />Blackfonz<br />Clara T.

Progressing from folkish harmonies, to country twang, world beats and southern home rock while further exploring themes of spiritual searching.</p><p>Possessing a whispery and intimate vocal style that works its way into the ear peacefully and directly, Joshua James is pitched midway between seminal influences like Bob Dylan and Neil Young.</p><p>""I find solace and beauty in darkness and depression,"" admits James, who grew up in his native Lincoln, Nebraska, skateboarding and sneaking listens to music his parents banned, like classic rockers Jim Morrison and The Doors, Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, ""But there are contrasts to everything. You have to combine the sweet and salty, the ugly and beautiful. Music is very therapeutic for me. It's all about making a connection with humanity, with the audience, in ways that I normally wouldn't be able to.""</p><p>Over the past three years, James has been doing just that. His debut was the #1 Folk Album on iTunes, and ""FM Radio,"" a song about a childhood friend coping with the death of his father, amassed more than 150,000 downloads as part of an iTunes promotion. In addition to performances at Sundance, SXSW and CMJ, James has toured with John Mayer, David Gray and Ani DiFranco, winning legions of fans along the way.</p><p>""I feel strongly about the things I sing about,"" nods Joshua. ""I want people to know how I feel, which sounds kind of dumb, because who cares how I feel? If someone feels similarly, though, that's what I'm looking for. That's the most important thing. If you can relate to what I'm going through, then I've achieved my goal.""</p><p>The album title, Build Me This, refers to his dream of salvation. ""It's my way of asking God to show himself,"" declares James. ""To prove he exists. Do something. Give me a sign. It's a call to whatever or whoever is out there. I don't want him to strike me down or paralyze me, just give me something to believe.""</p><p>Aside from the spiritual, Build Me This is also about the difficulties of everyday relationships, the inadvertent hurt we cause to those we love.  ""Magazine"" deals with the pain of separation (""Go take your bags to New York City, call me when your plane arrives/I'll feed the children, wash the dishes, I'll keep the house lookin' nice/Well don't you worry, everything's gonna be all right.""), while ""In the Middle"" laments a shattered romance (""You've tried so hard to forget me/You burnt the letters I'd made/Though my memory has been dyin'/I hope the feeling still remains"").</p><p>On the stage, though, is where Joshua James' music comes alive and reveals its true intent, which is about drawing people into his insular universe, a sense of mystic that only the truly great ones can communicate.</p><p>""Perhaps the darkness comes out a little more often that I'd like,"" he offers ""but that's just where I gravitate to when I'm writing. I don't usually try to tackle specific subjects; it's usually about what I'm feeling at the time. Things start to come out, then they form a story and a reason, and that's how things evolve. I'm influenced by everything... by life, by love, by hate, by music.""</p>",,,,,1066,Dan

He is who he is and he tells the unmatched story. Whether it be the story of love, the story of struggle, or the story of joy, the road that he travels on is full of dust and flowers, fire and ice, comets and dreams, and he walks with stars in his eyes, leaving the scent of wild magnolias for those on his trail...and for those of us at the end, we are fortunate to find him smiling. Tradition is a staple in Rayland's music. In any given song, one can hear the nuances of his favorites from Dylan to Van Zandt, Johnson to Hopkins, or anyone else on the musical map that has tickled his fancy at one time or another.

This can be heard on the past four albums by Five For Fighting, the band name under which he records and performs.</p><p>Ondrasik's debut album, the critically acclaimed, Message for Albert, was released in 1997. Five For Fighting's breakthrough came in 2001 with the Grammy-nominated song ""Superman"" from the Platinum certified ""America Town"" (Aware/Columbia) CD. Already climbing the charts prior to 9/11, ""Superman"" went on to have a life of his own, becoming a song of healing for the nation. John joined superstar musicians for the now legendary post 9/11 fundraiser The Concert For New York, which paid tribute to all the firefighters, police officers and paramedics affected by the events of September 11th.</p><p>In 2004, John recorded the Platinum-certified album, The Battle For Everything, which yielded the retrospective hit, ""100 Years,"" a song that has become a part of classic American songbook. With the 2006 release of Two Lights, featuring ""World,"" the hit song ""The Riddle,"" and ""Freedom Never Cries,"" John continued to craft songs with material drawn from his personal experience in regards to love, war, culture, family, humanity and mortality.</p><p>In the fall of 2007, Ondrasik released the first live Five For Fighting CD titled ""Live"", and the DVD, ""Back Country Live"" . The CD captures the band live in concert and the DVD features live concert footage, Five For Fighting Music videos, interviews and bonus features.</p><p>In addition to his musical accomplishments John has a made a personal commitment towards causes that are important to him. In February of 2007, Ondrasik launched a unique charity-driven web site, whatkindofworlddoyouwant.com that raises money for various charities when users view video clips provided by visitors to the site. Current views are over three million with approximately three hundred thousand dollars donated.</p><p>The success of the site led to late 2007 collaboration between Ondrasik and The History Channel, with the launching a user-generated video contest. Fans created a video on Eyespot.com describing what kind of world they want by making a video using archival footage of important historical events and the Five For Fighting song ""World"" as the music bed. One winning video was chosen to air on The History Channel.</p><p>John has also been a dedicated supporter of US troops. In March 2007, he performed at Guantanamo Bay for service members on his first USO/Armed Forces Entertainment tour. Since then John has performed for US forces on USO tours in Hawaii, Guam and Japan.</p><p>Ondrasik has also conceived and produced ""For the Troops,"" a CD compilation series of superstar recording artists that is available for free to every active service person in the US Armed Forces. Volume 1, released on Thanksgiving 2007, included Billy Joel, Brooks &amp; Dunn, Josh Groban, The Fray, Melissa Etheridge, Los Lonely Boys as well as Five For Fighting's ""100 Years."" Over 200,000 CDs were distributed in Iraq, Afghanistan, military hospitals, USO centers and to various troops support groups. Over three hundred and fifty thousand songs were downloaded from the Army/Air Force exchange online store aafes.com. ""For the Troops 2"", released on Thanksgiving 2008, includes Maroon 5, Keith Urban, Daughtry, 3 Doors Down, Five For Fighting, Roy Orbison and others.</p><p>Along with numerous television licenses, film credits include compositions for ""August Rush,"" ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"""" We Were Soldiers,"" ""Chicken Little"" and ""Everyone's Hero.""</p>",,,,,1054,No Compromise,http://www.myspace.com/nocompromise,,,,3501,"<p>An evil presence is out there seeking to destroy rock music.

Soon after the band's 1993 debut album ""Fuzzy"" was on the shelves they headed for Europe, it was there that the band had it's first taste of commercial and critical success. Soon, they found themselves headlining large venues and playing every major festival, touring at a dizzying pace.</p><p>At home a strong fan base was forming seeded by some of popular music's greatest names, and soon these band's offered Grant Lee Buffalo opening slots on major tours. Grant Lee Buffalo went on the road with REM, Pearl Jam and The Smashing Pumpkins to name just a few.  It was this incessant touring that earned Grant-Lee Buffalo a devoted following both in the States and abroad.</p><p>Meanwhile, Grant-Lee Phillips' searching, sometimes political songwriting continues to evolve well after the release of four major albums.  The singer-songwriter has always moved restlessly, beginning with the mercurial acoustic-fuzz driven ballads of ""Fuzzy,"" to the moody cinematic ""Mighty Joe Moon"" in '94 which yielded the classic single ""Mockingbirds."" From the diverse orchestral labyrinth of ""Copperopolis"" in '96 to the celebrational swan song of ""Jubilee,"" which brought with it the widely successful gem ""Truly, Truly.""</p><p>After being voted best male vocalist of '95 by Rolling Stone magazine, he was heralded by fans and critics alike as being both a visionary and one of the most important songwriters of his generation.  Known for his sweepingly cinematic forum that are both profoundly insightful and casually poetic his music continues on in this tradition.</p><p>In 1999 after many tumultuous changes at Warner Brothers both the band and the company had reached an impasse. Shortly after a long tour of duty in Australia promoting Jubilee word circulated that Phillips would continue on alone, while the fate of Grant Lee Buffalo would remain open. It was during this time that a mutual agreement was found, Warners would not pick up the option if Phillips wanted to go elsewhere and so he packed his bags and looked forward to the future.</p><p>Currently, Phillips is busy in Los Angeles playing to rapidly sold out shows at Largo.  During these performances he has been showcasing new songs and approaches.  His recent material carries the same depth and insight as his previous work but with added vibrancy and a new experimental edge. A bonus to Phillips solo engagements has been the exposure of a deeply human side, a unique, off beat sense of humor and love of spontaneity that might have been lost in the echo of mammoth venues.</p>",,,,,1042,"Army Of Me (acoustic) ""MAKE YOURSELF NAKED EP"" Release Party",http://www.myspace.com/armyofme,,http://www.youtube.com/user/armyofme,http://www.armyofmeonline.com,3913,"<p>Monday, November 2 will be the ""MAKE YOURSELF NAKED EP"" Release Party for Army Of Me...</p><p>Call it a comeback.

Their debut record ""Citizen"" was greeted with predictions of commercial success. Allmusic.com said ""it's pretty easy to the band scoring radio hits and jumping into the mainstream consciousness quickly."" It was a big, bombastic, slickly produced album - without a lot of room for whispering.</p><p>You could say that the 5 song ""Make Yourself Naked EP"" is the musical opposite of ""Citizen."" Hoping to capture some sketches for new Army of Me songs, Vince holed up in his bedroom in Washington DC and simply pressed the ""record"" button on his laptop. What he inadvertently captured was, according to Vince, ""an unexpected image of a naked man."" It's surely a private moment - just like he's singing in the shower, only you're invited.

The resulting self-titled album, released Sept. 26 on Triple Crown/East West, provides dramatic evidence that they met this self-imposed challenge, and then some.<br /><br />As Tall As Lions' journey toward maturation began in casual fashion, the original version of the band forming around Fitzgerald while the members were still in high school. During the next few years, they endured the lineup changes and artistic roadblocks many young bands experience before taking their present, permanent form. But they still had some growing to do.<br /><br />""When we started doing Lafcadio, we really didn't understand what we were getting ourselves into - we were just kids"" says Nigro. ""We had made a couple demos, put them on the Internet and, after a couple of days, we had a record labels calling us ready to sign the band. We all thought this whole band thing was going to come too easily after that. We dropped out of college and made As Tall As Lions our priority. At first, it was a tough adjustment. We'd never been on tour before, and getting used to life on the road was draining. I think we've all grown up a lot since then, and our attitude has changed for the better. We put everything we had into this new record and are extremely happy with how it came out.""<br /><br />But it didn't come easy, as ATAL hit some speed bumps along the way. ""Recording this record was not a walk in the park."" Nigro admits. ""There were a lot of passionate and vibrant discussions [read: arguments] during the creative period, and at one point I had to just leave for a while get away from it all."" As it turned out, the hiatus, gave Nigro the inspiration he and the rest of the band needed. ""I came back with a clear head and was ready to write, record and be with my band. It all clicked after that.""<br /><br />What emerged is an album entrenched in moody, soulful rock and roll - at once life-affirming, sensual and technically sophisticated - that seamlessly intertwines the members' eclectic tastes, encompassing Neil Young, Can, Elbow and the Buena Vista Social Club. Produced by Steven Haigler (Brand New, Quicksand) and Mike Watts, As Tall As Lions is an album of irrepressible songcraft in which shimmering anthems (""Ghost Of York"") stand alongside odes to love and resilience (""Milk And Honey"").<br /><br />""There weren't any rules,"" says Nigro. ""We didn't want to be a band that limited ourselves or made rules about writing our music. In the past, we would come up with an idea and say, 'Oh, we can't do that - we're a rock band.' We felt shoved in a box. Two years ago, if we were to toss the idea around of having a dozen kids sing on a song [""Love, Love, Love (Love, Love)""], we would have thought it was absurd. Well, why? It'd be awesome to have little kids singing on our record.""<br /><br />As Tall As Lions vividly demonstrates what can happen when inspiration and dedication intersect at the right moment in a talented band's evolution.

After 5 long days they emerged with a fine peice of honest rock n' roll entitled ""The Edge of America"".</p><p>It all started with a little encouragement. Although, Mike Dunn has been in a number of bands through his young career he had never been showcased as a frontman. In late 2005 Mike began recording demos under the name Palomino. Once confident enough in these demos he brought them to Louis DeFabrizio (Gasoline Heart, The Kick). DeFabrizio immediately found potential in the tracks and took on the project as both a experienced player and accomplished producer.</p><p>""I looked up to Lou, still do."" says Mike. ""I wanted to do something with some heart, with some soul, with some energy, something real that could acctually mean something to people."" Drawing on influences from Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Paul Westerberg, and Bob Dylan, Mike eventually came out with a combination that is completely his own.</p><p>""At the end of the day, the song is the most important thing."" Mike Dunn and the Kings of New England make music that is distinctly American and distinctly part of an emerging crew of honest rock n' roll bands from their area, including DeFabrizio's own Gasoline Heart. Although this is just the beginning of the road for Mike Dunn and the Kings of New England they bring a confidence in their musicianship to the stage that is rarely seen by bands twice their age and energy to match. With the release of their debut E.P., The Edge of America, this spring Mike and the Kings have a lot to look forward to. Enjoy the ride.</p>",,,,,986,We Shot The Moon,http://www.myspace.com/weshotthemoon,http://www.facebook.com/weshotthemoon,http://www.youtube.com/weshotthemoon,,3402,,,,,,980,with Rosy Likes Red + Victory by Revenge,,,,,0,,,,,,979,Save the Music! feat.,,,,,0,,,,,,973,An Evening with Marshall Crenshaw,http://www.myspace.com/marshallcrenshaw,,,http://www.marshallcrenshaw.com,7552,"<p>Over 25 years since breaking through to critical and commercial acclaim with his 1982 self-titled debut and its infectious, era-defining pop hit ""Someday, Someway,"" Marshall Crenshaw creates an incredible new chapter in his career with his 429 Records debut Jaggedland. Crenshaw's first studio recording in more than six years is his most musically dynamic and lyrically intimate collection yet.</p><p>Classic Crenshaw attributes including an indelible sense of melody and tuneful essence combine to create a rich warmth and intimacy on every song of Jaggedland. The recording has a powerful vibe of immediacy thanks to Crenshaw's warm vocals and riveting guitar work. He takes the production to its highest levels working with a roster of well known musical heroes and veteran producers. Crenshaw first recorded two tracks in Upstate New York with Stewart Lerman (The Roches, Dar Williams), the melancholy ""Sunday Blues"" and the fiery rocker ""Someone Told Me."" Crenshaw did seven of the tracks at Sage and Sound Studios in Los Angeles with producer/engineer Jerry Boys (REM, Richard Thompson, Buena Vista Social Club), who had been his ""wish list"" since he heard the Mambo Sinuendo album Boys engineered for Ry Cooder and Cuban guitarist Manuel Galban in 2003. Highlights of these West Coast sessions are ""Passing Through,"" the hopeful ""Eventually"" and the powerful ""Long Hard Road.""</p><p>The album title Jaggedland is a term Crenshaw says best describes the current state of his brain and consciousness. Simply put, the 12 songs are musical observations about the human experience, mortality, the state of the world and of course, love as viewed through the inimitable Crenshaw perspective. The sessions involved key contributions from legendary drummer Jim Keltner (whose credits include The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Brian Wilson and Joni Mitchell); guitarists Greg Leisz (Lucinda Williams, Robert Plant) and the MC5's Wayne Kramer as well as legendary vibraphonist, Emil Richards (Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Frank Sinatra).</p><p>""It was exciting and inspiring to work with such amazing musicians and producers. I fell in love with Mambo Sinuendo five years ago,"" Crenshaw continues, ""and when I started thinking about recording my next record, Jerry immediately came to mind. When I found out that he was once an assistant engineer for The Beatles--that sealed the deal!""</p><p>""I also owe Stewart Lerman much of the credit for getting the ball rolling and inspiring me to start thinking about writing and recording this album,"" Crenshaw adds. ""When we ran into each other at a political event in 2004, he gave me a pep talk and said he wanted to work with me. We hooked up about a year later and I started dabbling in new songs. As things went along, I started to feel like the material was taking on some unexpected dimensions and it dawned on me that I still have such a huge appreciation and respect for records as an art form--and a deep love for the power of songs and music. Even at this late stage of the game, with so many years and recordings behind me, I felt compelled to step up and reach as deep into myself as I could. That renewed sense of passion and commitment is the driving force behind the songs on Jaggedland, which I truly believe are some of my best ever.""</p><p>Born in Detroit, Michigan, Crenshaw began playing guitar at age ten and he received his first break playing John Lennon in the off-Broadway company of Beatlemania. In 1987, he played Buddy Holly in the Richie Valens biopic ""La Bamba.""</p><p>Living in NYC, he recorded the single ""Something's Gonna Happen"" for Alan Betrock's Shake Records, which led to a deal with Warner Bros. His debut album, Marshall Crenshaw was acclaimed as a pop masterpiece upon its release in 1982 and established him as a first-rate songwriter, singer and guitarist. The record spawned the Top 40 single ""Someday, Someway,"" which rockabilly singer Robert Gordon scored a hit with a year earlier. Crenshaw's second album, 1983's Field Day, was another critical smash and led to a successful slate of 20-plus years of studio recordings that offered a fascinating evolutionary journey through an array of musical landscapes.</p><p>A quote from Trouser Press sums up Marshall Crenshaw's early career: ""Although he was seen as a latter-day Buddy Holly at the outset, he soon proved too talented and original to be anyone but himself."" All Music Guide captured Crenshaw's vibe perfectly: ""He writes songs that are melodic, hooky and emotionally true, and he sings and plays them with an honesty and force that still finds room for humor without venom.""</p><p>As Crenshaw was developing Jaggedland's mix of poignant and incisive love songs and musings on mortality, he ventured once again into the film world, co-penning the title track to the hilarious, critically acclaimed John C. Reilly film ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story""; the track was nominated for a 2008 Golden Globe and a 2008 Grammy Award.</p><p>Over the last few years, Crenshaw has played 40 - 50 shows a year on what he dubs ""the NPR singer-songwriter circuit."" Says Crenshaw, ""This album took a lot of wear and tear on my emotions, but in the end I think it's one of my best ever and I am so excited to have worked with so many of my favorite players on it. When people ask me why I keep making music after all these years, I have a simple answer: because I have to. For lack of a more colorful term, there is truly something magical to it and I never take it for granted.""</p>",,,,,971,Will Kimbrough,,,,,0,,,,,,970,Kim

king, Aimee Mann queen, and the The Beatles never put out another record after Revolver."" Steve Horowitz, popmatters.com</p><p>""Richey entices you with sad and unembellished music that reveals an original spirit - and then she ensnares you for keeps by making you consider all the noiseless sensations that no songs can ever contain."" Timothy White, Billboard Magazine</p><p>Two-time Grammy-nominated Kim is a storyteller; a weaver of emotions and a tugger of heartstrings. Tender, poetic and aching with life's truths, Kim's songs transport you to her world, where words paint pictures and melodies touch the soul. And then there's her voice. Pure, arresting and honest, her voice makes you take notice; Kim has the kind of voice where if emotions were ribbons, they'd be streaming in rainbow colours from your iPod. Her voice gives you goose bumps.</p><p>The 15-year musical journey that has led Kim to her latest album, ""Wreck Your Wheels"" has been a dream run. Aside from her two Grammy nods, she has released five critically acclaimed albums; been listed in the Top 10 Albums of 1999 in US Time Magazine for her album ""Glimmer"", and been given 4 stars in Rolling Stone and named Alt-Country Album Of The Year in People Magazine for her album ""Rise"". She has written two Number 1s and four Top 10 hits in the USA and singles in the Top 50. She has had her songs recorded by the likes of Trisha Yearwood and James Morrisson among others; sung on albums by Ryan Adams, Shawn Colvin and Mary Chapin Carpenter and even appeared on a William Shatner record produced by Ben Folds. She's worked with producer legends such as Bill Bottrell (Sheryl Crow, Michael Jackson, Tom Petty) and Hugh Padgham (The Police, XTC, Peter Gabriel, David Bowie) as well as Giles Martin (The Beatles ""Love"") and Steve Earle collaborator Richard Bennett, plus she's had her music featured in films and TV and has toured all over the world.</p><p>Lyrically driven and beautifully produced, ""Wreck Your Wheels"" is a record that gets into your head and heart and stays there. So does it matter whether it's Americana, Alt-country or Pop? We say, forget the labels. Just listen to the music. Decide for yourself.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fkim-richey%252Fid39481%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/kimrichey,,968,Popa Chubby CD Release Show,http://www.myspace.com/popachubbyband,,http://www.youtube.com/user/galeabadhousewife,http://www.popachubby.com,4770,"<p>The ever-prolific Popa Chubby returns with a new CD of hard-hitting rock &lsquo;n' roll, Deliveries After Dark, a collection of balls-out Blues/Rock played with reckless abandon, no apologies, visceral and heavy, with a few surprises thrown in - such as the theme from ""The Godfather"" rearranged as a surf guitar instrumental, and the spacey and evocative ""Woman In My Bed Dub,"" a reggae tune as thick with smoke as a Kingston club. Elsewhere, Chubby indulges his need for speed with the road-raging ""Deliveries After Dark,"" and revved-up boogie of ""Sally Likes To Run,"" while ""Let The Music Set You Free"" lays out Chubby's philosophy over a swaggering, rock solid riff. With Deliveries After Dark, Popa Chubby continues to rule the road with his high-octane ax work and uncompromising, in your face attitude, resulting in a supercharged mix that spits fire at every turn.</p>",,,,,967,An Evening with Fran Healy and Andy Dunlop from Travis,,,,http://www.travisonline.com,0,,,,,,965,Jill Sobule,http://www.myspace.com/jillsobule/,http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/profile.php?id=715433906,http://www.youtube.com/JillSobuleDotCom,http://www.jillsobule.com,6285,"<p>Jill Sobule belongs to a rare breed of artists. Her work is at once deeply personal and socially conscious, seriously funny and derisively tragic. Over five albums and a decade of recording, the Denver-born songwriter/guitarist/singer has tackled such topics as the death penalty, anorexia, shoplifting, reproduction, the French resistance movement, adolescence, and the Christian right. Did we mention love? Love found, love lost, love wished for and love taken away.</p><p>While her songs cover a huge amount of ground, they all have benefit greatly from Jill's subtle intelligence and skillful light-handedness. No sloganeering flag-and-fist waving here, but rather story songs about human beings, real and imagined, which allow us to step back from the issue, be it personal or social, and relate to it as we would a close friend.</p><p>To see Jill live and in concert is a rare treat. It is on stage that she is most comfortable, most powerful, and where the delicacy and range of her work can be best appreciated. She entertains, amuses, provokes, and more often then not, takes her audiences on an emotional roller coaster, from comedy to pathos in a few bars of music.</p><p>Jill began playing guitar when she joined the Junior High School band. She never learned to read music, though, and faked her way through rehearsals and performances by playing by ear. As she began writing songs, it was very clear to Jill this was becoming more than a teenage hobby. Music was serious stuff. She played in a variety of funk and rock bands in Colorado, and eventually made her first, Todd Rundgren-produced, album for MCA, Things Here Are Different.</p><p>But success did not knock on her door until three years later, when Atlantic Records released her MTV staple and national top 20 hit, I Kissed A Girl. ""That song was a double-edged sword for me,"" Jill Says. ""It was perceived as a novelty hit, but on the other hand it was the first song with an overtly gay topic to be aired on Top 40 radio. I am quite proud of that."" The self-titled album also yielded another hit song, Supermodel, included in the Clueless soundtrack.</p><p>The song also jumpstarted her live music career in a big way, and since then she's had the honor to induct Neil Diamond in the Songwriter's Hall of Fame, to share the stage with the likes of Neil Young (at his yearly Bridge School benefit concerts), fellow activists Billy Bragg &amp; Steve Earle, and Waren Zevon. Quite the serious guitar player, she even toured the world as lead guitarist in Lloyd Cole's band a few years back.</p><p>Since then, she has made four more critically acclaimed albums, Happy Town, Pink Pearl, Underdog Victorious, and 2009's California Years, which Jill released on her own record label, Pinko Records, after collecting over $85,000 from fans who funded the project.</p><p>A veritable gypsy, Jill divides her time between a busy touring schedule and a variety of other projects. She has played the role of political troubadour for NPR stations across the country and for Air America Radio. She also served as songwriter/composer for the hit Nickelodeon network show Unfabulous during that show's three-season run. She composed the music for the off-Broadway show Prozak and the Platypus and co-starred in the Eric Schaeffer film Mind the Gap.</p><p>In the words of New York Times pop music critic Jon Pareles, ""Jill Sobule can claim her place among the stellar New York singer-songwriters of the last decade. Topical, funny and more than a little poignant ... grown-up music for an adolescent age.""</p>",,,,,964,Erin McKeown,http://www.myspace.com/erinmckeown,,,http://erinmckeown.com,3168,"<p>Erin McKeown has packed a ton of music into a substantial career. With 6 albums, 2 EPs, and numerous soundtracks and compilations to her credit, the 31-year-old songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer hasn't stopped for a breather in the last 10 years. Along the way she has averaged 200 shows a year and garnered the praise of fans and critics alike.</p><p>McKeown's latest project is a brand new full length album of original songs, due in the fall of 2009. Produced by Sam Kassirer and mixed by Brian Deck, Erin's latest will continue in her unique tradition of fresh and unusual music. Meanwhile, she's begun to step out as an in-demand side player. This year she'll also be contributing regularly to her ongoing writing projects including blogs, essays, and poems.</p><p>Erin McKeown has performed her songs all over the world, and her music has been featured on television shows ""The LWord"", ""Gilmore Girls"", ""Priveleged"", ""Jake in Progress"", and ""Nip/Tuck"". She has appeared in People Magazine, on the cover of Paste Magazine, on NPR, Jools Holland, and Conan O'Brien. She's proud to have shared the stage with friends Andrew Bird, Ani DiFranco, Amy Ray, Martin Sexton, Josh Ritter, Michelle Shocked, Mike Doughty, Matt Nathanson, Stephen Kellogg, and Richard Thompson.</p>",,,,,960,Danni Rosner,http://www.myspace.com/dannirosner,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Danni-Rosner/26052441987,http://www.youtube.com/user/DanniRosnerMusic,http://dannirosner.com,3140,"<p>Danni Rosner writes music all the time- in the car, in the shower- sometimes in the grocery store. Like many songwriters, she writes wherever the inspiration strikes her...but it's the honesty of her branded organic pop that plays just as much into the catchiness of her tunes, as do the 'can't get 'em out of your head' melodies, calming chords, soothing progressions and the (intended) lack of overproduction.</p><p>Her new album- PIANO ACTRESS- tells you more about her than a bio ever could: it's a year-long collection of stories told through the eyes and the soul of her life as the 'piano actress'. The album blends a chilled vibe with emotional intensity- it's one part soul, one part rock and all parts heart.</p><p>From the punch of the first song, ""Piano Actress,"" the LP features full band selections, but also includes songs that are simply complex. ""Over the Top,"" and ""My Piano"" like all of her songs, were written on the keys, but are presented without embellishment- hauntingly stripped and revealing vulnerability.</p><p>The vibe continues with ""Rock on By,"" where Danny Kalb (Beck, Ben Harper, Rilo Kiley, Jack Johnson) and Danni, instead of recording a new studio cut of the song, used a 2 AM demo version recorded in her apartment months prior, because it magically captures the raw emotion of her voice in the most organic kind of way (you can even hear the AC running in the background and her clicking her MACbook to begin the recording.)</p><p>It's clear Danni knows who she is, and her sophomore indie release, PIANO ACTRESS, sweetly defines the definition.</p><p>Danni grew up in Tokyo and returned to the states in high school. An Alumni of Virginia Tech, she holds degrees in Musical Analysis and English.</p><p>She's worked as a TV reporter in Italy, a touring blues singer, and sang the anthem at major sports venues in DC (Verizon Center, RFK Stadium, Nationals Park). She's opened for Matt Nathanson and soon- the Wallflowers. Her next honor- being chosen to perform at Amateur Night at the Apollo in Harlem- was June 3, (where she made Top 3 and continues on to Round 2 June 17). She currently shares her love of music with viewers throughout the US as host to a music video TV show called Strictly Global on a national channel.</p><p>And with that, she says with a smile, ""I'm all over the place, and I wouldn't want it any other way.""</p>",,,,,957,4th Annual Rocknoceros New Years Eve Party,,,http://vimeo.com/4064606,http://www.rocknoceros.com,7699,"<p><strong><em>*Rocknoceros will do a full-fledged countdown and an apple juice toast for all!</em></strong></p><p>As every family with youngsters in the DC area already knows, Rocknoceros (pronounced like rhinoceros) is three guys: Coach Cotton, Williebob, and Boogie Woogie Bennie. After seeing them perform, there is no denying that they are not a typical trio. Coach Cotton is the ring-leader, frequently immersed in a sea of knee-high concert goers. Wearing a wireless head-set microphone, he wades through the mass of dancing children, dispersing high-fives and shaking a tambourine. Williebob provides the necessary string work for the show, moving among a collection of guitars, mandolins, and banjos while wearing a kazoo around his neck. Boogie Woogie Bennie is a one-man-band within the power trio, employing a contraption that one four-year-old fan described as ""the piano-drum"". The piano-drum allows Boogie Bennie to play the bass drum with his right foot, the snare drum and hi-hat cymbal with his left foot, and the keyboard with his hands (with his left hand playing the bass parts). Together, Rocknoceros is able to cover a dizzying range of musical styles in each set. From Tin Pan Alley to the shores of Jamaica, Rocknoceros hops from genre to genre like a toad on summer asphalt.</p>",,,,,954,fun.,http://www.myspace.com/fun,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Fun/31508205711,http://www.youtube.com/ournameisfun,http://ournameisfun.com,3114,"<p>Iggy Pop was wrong.  There is, in fact, fun.</p><p>Fun is what happens when three extraordinarily talented musicians come together to create something altogether new and wonderful.  Nate Ruess, late of The Format, has teamed up with ex-Anathallo multi-instrumentalist Andrew Dost and Steel Train's Jack Antonoff, resulting in their ingenious debut, ""AIM AND IGNITE.""  The trio melds a stunning array of diverse inspirations - spanning Broadway to The Beach Boys, ""NILSSON SCHMILSSON"" to ""PINKERTON"" - into an irresistible collection of freewheeling pop songcraft.  Songs like ""Benson Hedges"" and ""All The Pretty Girls"" are fit to burst with richly prolix lyricism and intricate melodic twists and turns, which provide plenty of room for Ruess' distinctive vocals to soar.  With ""AIM AND IGNITE,"" Fun have crafted something special indeed, a contemporary rethinking of classic 70s pop, where ornate arrangements and inspired orchestrations meet present-day rock &lsquo;n' roll.</p>",,,,,952,Baigis,,,,,0,,,,,,951,"Mercury In Summer ""In Your Face"" EP Release Show",http://www.myspace.com/mercuryinsummer,http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/MercuryinSummer?ref=ts,http://www.youtube.com/mercuryinsummer ,http://mercuryinsummer.com/,9059,"<p>Mercury in Summer is a three piece rock band from the D.C. area. Their music speaks for itself; high energy, catchy songs with a musical flair that at times recalls the grooves of Michael Jackson, the vocal harmonies of the Four Freshmen, and the instrumental fluidity of Return to Forever. ""Wait, those aren't rock bands!"" you might say; and yes you're correct. But Mercury in Summer is.</p><p>Tip-toeing the line between familiar and strange, fans say that Mercury in Summer seems to effortlessly incorporate other genres into their style. And you'll be saying the same thing, especially after seeing them live.</p><p>Richard Wynne (Lead Vocals, Guitar), Brendan McCusker (Drums, Vocals), and Brian Jones (Bass, Vocals) don't get up on stage to ""play the record"" - no, they put on a show. One filled with riveting improvisation, a non-stop arsenal of killer songs, and arrangement embellishments to keep the audience out of their seats and on their feet. After seeing their show, you may end up asking yourself when the last time was that you saw a band that wasn't only ""as good"" as their CD, but even better in concert; like Mercury in Summer.</p><p>Their highly anticipated release ""I Believe"" has been a huge success, recorded by famed engineer/producer Dave Way (Michael Jackson, Christina Aguilera, Foo Fighters, Paul McCartney), and sagaciously guided by executive producer John Molo (Bruce Hornsby and the Range, Phil Lesh and Friends, John Fogerty).</p><p>Yes, things have been going pretty well for Mercury in Summer lately; considering their recent airplay on DC101 and 98 rock, trips around the U.S. to play festivals exceeding 17,000 attendees (Gathering of the Vibes), and a surge of interviews from college radio and newspapers a like.

The band is now touring nationwide, wowing  audiences with outrageous and campy, white-trash persona and  freewheeling, sleazy tone.

However, unlike most pop artists on the scene today, Webb's engaged, committed fan_�base is constantly expanding - in part because Derek Webb has a tendency to give his music away for free.</p><p>In 2006, Webb convinced his label, INO Records / Columbia Records, to give away over 80,000 free downloads of his critically acclaimed album, MOCKINGBIRD. This widely publicized promotion more than doubled Webb's concert audiences and eventually paved the way for Webb to launch a revolutionary, new online music distribution system, NoiseTrade. In less than a year, NoiseTrade has put a small army of independent artists in direct contact with fans around the world who have downloaded over 1,280,000 songs from its website: www. noisetrade.com.</p><p>Derek Webb's latest project Sola-Mi has been described as a, ""concept band featuring Derek Webb, Josh Moore (Co-producer of Webb's Stockholm Syndrome and Feedback albums), and Latifah Phillips (of The Autumn Film and Page CXVI), commissioned and inspired by Solomon Mente's groundbreaking fictional narrative and film, NEXUS.""</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fderek-webb%252Fid1501037%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/derekwebb,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/FAanDNtrsMo"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/qi27OZ_8VFI"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"930,Sarah Borges and the Broken Singles - POSTPONED,,,http://www.youtube.com/user/sbbsvideo,http://www.sarahborges.com/,0,"<p>""Blessed with brassy pipes and charisma a-plenty..."" <em>-Time Out NY</em></p><p>On March 24, 2009 Sugar Hill Records will release Sarah Borges &amp; the Broken Singles' second album for the label, &lsquo;The Stars Are Out.' The Paul Q. Kolderie (Radiohead, Lemonheads, Juliana Hatfield) produced album is a ""fiery"" (NY Times) ten song collection of five originals and five choice re-imaginations of Borges' and Kolderie's favorites including ""Ride With Me"" written by fellow Boston native Evan Dando. The album opens with the honky-tonk infused punk rocker, ""Do It For Free"" showcasing Borges' smoky, honeyed vocals and scorching guitar work. This driving ode to an old flame would be right at home on the Sunset Strip in 1978 - Borges declares, ""I never forget what my mama said to me, when it's real love, you do it for free."" Originals ""Me and Your Ghost"" and ""Symphony"" combine the band's rockabilly, blues and rock and roll aesthetics and center on Borges' trademark lead vocals and capture the band's raucous and good time live act. She takes ""Being With You"" (most famously recorded by Smokey Robinson) and transforms it into a bittersweet lament accompanied by gospel like backing vocals when she pleads, ""I don't care about anything else but being with you."" &lsquo;The Stars Are Out' is a worthy follow up to 2007's &lsquo;Diamonds in the Dark'which drew praise across the board from the likes of The Boston Globe (""the playfully charismatic Borges truly shines""), Time Out New York (""irresistible"") and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (""just a whole lot of fun"").

Rather then shy away from the competition, however, ETA relished the challenge, the local music scene emboldening them to create bigger and better tracks. Sweet pop influences filter through their distinctive rock undertones, pulling you in and gripping you tightly until the very last notes have finished ringing in your eardrums.

The band was created by singer and songwriter Benjamin David, complimented by Ryan Wagner on guitar and Mike Riddile on electric piano. Benjamin's ear for strong melodies, blended with heart felt lyrics, provide the blueprint for their songs which combine rhythmic dance elements and crunching guitars to create their style of good ol' fashion rock n roll.

Raised in Waterford, Michigan, Lucca began singing at age 3; by 12 he was writing and playing in Detroit-area bands. As a teen, he lived in Orlando, Florida, where he worked for four seasons on the Disney Channel's ""Mickey Mouse Club"" alongside such future superstars as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and *Nsync's Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez.</p><p><br />It wasn't until the Michigan-native turned 18 and moved to Los Angeles that he realized his true potential as a legitimate artist. After familiarizing himself with the landscape, Lucca began writing and recording music with some of the most talented artists and players around. Lucca, who is based in LA, went the internet route and sold his first two independent releases, his debut ""So Satisfied"" (1997) and the follow-up ""Strong Words, Softly Spoken"" (1999), through his own website. His first commercially distributed album, ""Shotgun,"" arrived in 2004. It was succeeded by his Rock Ridge Music debut ""Canyon Songs"" (2006) and ""Come Around Again"" (2008), ""Rendezvous With The Angels"" (2010) , and Lucca's most recent release, ""Under The Influence,"" which came out in 2011 (a 10-song compilation of tunes by artists that influenced Lucca as a musician and songwriter).</p><p><br />His songs have been featured on TV's ""Friday Night Lights,"" ""Brothers &amp; Sisters,"" ""Shark,"" and ""Felicity"" and in Kevin Costner's feature ""Open Range."" He has been seen on E! Entertainment Televsion and A&amp;E, and performed numerous times on NBC's ""Last Call With Carson Daly."" In 2011, he appeared as himself on NBC's ""Parenthood,"" performing his song ""Like Love."" Lucca was also tapped to appear in friend Justin Timberlake's 901 Tequila commercial spot. Over the course of his career, Lucca has shared stages with *Nsync, Marc Anthony, Macy Gray, Johnny Lang, the late Chris Whitley, Sara Bareilles, and Tyrone Wells. Lucca has also completed several cooperative tours with Jay Nash and Matt Duke (which resulted in ""TFDI,"" a collaborative EP recorded at SPACE in Evanston, Illinois, and released by Rykodisc in late 2009, and ""When I Stop Running,"" a full-length album by the trio that was released by Rock Ridge Music in the summer of 2011).</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Ftony-lucca%252Fid5437436%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/Luccadoes,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/RoIrfnNEMqk"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""225"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/MXjWlnlnaHM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"915,Betaraz DMV Showcase Vol. 6,http://www.myspace.com/farazb36,,,,2988,"<p><strong>Performing Live:</strong></p><p>Johnny 3 Legs &amp; The Franchise Players<br />TheFiveOne<br />Emperess<br />Revolution<br />Gif<br />Benji<br />Teflon<br />Dia<br />Nando<br />Grand Marquis aka Montana<br />Wink O<br />Tone Capone<br />Champ Yon<br />VeRs<br />Toney Nightmare<br />D Wayz</p>",,,,,913,Rock 4 Rescue Benefit Concert,,,,http://www.gooddogz.org/index.php/content/view/115/153/,3028,"<p>R-O-C-K out for a good cause with GoodDogz.org at the Rock 4 Rescue benefit concert!

Released on singer and band mastermind, Ashley Albert's own Pluckypea Records, the collection features The Jimmies' songs, music videos, a 45-minute live concert, karaoke sing-a-longs, a bonus live CD and a ""Film 101"" behind-the-scenes documentary on how the videos were made.</p><p>Trying Funny Stuff captures The Jimmies' signature blend of sophisticated imagery, laugh-out-loud humor and subtle lessons (like how to sneeze into your arm, set a tadpole free and layer in the wintertime).</p><p>Also on November 3, The Jimmies will make available nationally for the first time their Parents' Choice and Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Award-winning debut CD, Make Your Own Someday. The critically acclaimed album-which was initially distributed out of Albert's living room-garnered national visibility as it hit #1 twice on Sirius/XM Radio's kids' music chart and earned the band spots performing at Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Festival in 2008.</p><p>It's been three years since The Jimmies accidentally began, when someone tried to hire Albert's non-existent kindie-rock band. Instead of coming clean, Albert tried her hand at songwriting and flew down to Miami to produce the album with her dad and uncle-veteran record producers, Howard and Ron Albert-at their studio, Audio Vision. She then returned to New York, found a band, started dreaming up videos with Trying Funny Stuff director/co-producer, Michael Slavens, bought a bubble gun and a groundhog puppet and never looked back.</p><p>When she's not working on The Jimmies, Ashley spends her days as a voice-over actress for cartoons, commercials, books-on-tape &amp; television shows. At any given moment, you might hear her telling you about the whole-grain goodness of Lucky Charms, the virtues of McDonald's Filet-o-Fish or what's coming up next on HGTV, MTV or Nickelodeon.

For Charlotte Martin, Stromata means more. A fitting title for the latest release from the Los Angeles-based artist, Stromata is not only the story of a girl who saw her way through hardship, but also the statement of a woman who took charge of herself and her music, redefining what she is made of.</p><p>Circumstances changed for Charlotte in the two years since she began writing and recording songs for Stromata. After five years and two releases on RCA Records-the EP In Parentheses (2003) and the full-length On Your Shore (2004)-Charlotte left the label in early 2005. Undeterred, she released the Darkest Hour and Veins EPs on Test-Drive Records that same year, and embarked on headlining tours in support of each. The Veins tour climaxed with the private taping of Something Like A DVD in Los Angeles in November 2005, and the following spring headlined another tour to coincide with the pre-released DVD. Along the way, Charlotte married her longtime collaborator and co-producer, Ken Andrews (Pete Yorn, Year of the Rabbit, Failure). Together, they formed Dinosaur Fight Records and aligned the new venture with Fontana Distribution.</p><p>With a newfound freedom to create music, Charlotte found herself at musical and personal crossroads.  Two years of virtually nonstop touring had effects. While on the road, Charlotte experienced the spectrum of human emotion: heartbreak, loss, guilt, and triumph. These years of intense transition and infinite potential found themselves in the words, notes, and production of Stromata.</p><p>No longer beholden to the demands of label executives or hampered by artistic insecurity, Charlotte emerged a strong, self-aware artist knowing what she wants from her career, and what she needs to feed her muse. With experiences of the past propelling her forward, Charlotte began writing and recording Stromata.  For the first time since the beginning of her career-from singing with her mom in the car at age 3, to directing show choirs at 14, to graduating from Eastern Illinois University with an opera degree at 21-she had a clear vision of what her music needed to be and how to make it. Taking the production helm, Charlotte was inspired to take the focus off the acoustic piano and indulge in the world of analog synthesizers, digital percussion, and vocal collages.</p><p>Coming into her own as a composer/producer/engineer, Charlotte experimented extensively in the studio, both lyrically and sonically, for Stromata. Unafraid, she wrote about faith and relationships, allowing herself to be honest about letting some things go and fiercely holding on to others. She approached the production with the same fearlessness. Looking to nobody but herself in the studio, Charlotte completed all of the initial demos and digital percussion on her own-a stark and compelling contrast to the full-on live band and orchestra recordings of On Your Shore. In addition to implementing new micing methods and rhythmic ideas, Charlotte explored the far reaches of her own vocal harmonizing and layering techniques, resulting in a powerfully diverse collection of tracks showcasing the true power of her voice and skill as a songwriter.</p><p>Stromata stands as Charlottes most ambitious and experimental album to date. Resonant drums, electronic flourishes, and illustrative synth and keyboard work form a lush backdrop for Charlottes expressive storytelling and classically trained voice. Stromata is the expression rooted in a lifetime of experience forming the fabric of a true artist.</p><p>Stromata is now available in stores and online.</p>",,,,,895,An Evening with Chatham County Line,http://www.myspace.com/chathamcountyline,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Chatham-County-Line/40316138806?v=app_19935916616#!/pages/Chatham-County-Line/40316138806?v=info ,,http://chathamcountyline.com,8241,"<p>Ten years in, the four gentlemen of Chatham County Line have a lot to reflect on: sold out shows in the US and abroad, appearances on national radio &amp; TV, four solid selling records, and four really dirty suits.</p><p>""We want to be the band that puts on the most professional show in the business of what we do,"" says singer/guitarist/songwriter Dave Wilson. ""If you've taken your time to be there for us, we are going to prove we are there for you."" It's that sincerity of showmanship and professionalism that has led to countless miles on the road for CCL. ""We've worn out two vans by now and I've actually worn out a few ties as well,"" says John Teer. ""You ever hear of someone wearing out a tie?"" Teer plays mandolin and fiddle and sings high tenor for the band. It is this commitment that has fans driving hundreds of miles to see Chatham County Line at work on the road. ""We've had fans travel from another country to catch a show,"" reflects banjoist Chandler Holt, continuing, ""That's when you know you're doing something right."" Releasing IV to critical acclaim in 2008, CCL was invited to be on Later. . . with Jools Holland on BBC 2 in the UK, alongside such acts as The Raconteurs, Nick Cave, and Bon Iver. ""Now that was a party,"" muses standup bassist Greg Readling. ""When you've got those guys coming up and introducing themselves to you, all the miles just melt away.""</p><p>The newest addition to their catalog, Wildwood, is no departure from the path CCL has been carving during its decade of existence. Another strong batch of songs, with solid melodies and lyrics, telling the tales of what all those years on the road have brought to them. ""I guess I'm out of the running / Thanks for your applause,"" sings Dave Wilson on the track Out of the Running. ""We may never grace the cover of Rolling Stone,"" Dave says, ""but at this point, that is not something we care about. We might reach for the stars, but we're mostly concerned with making great music that speaks to us and our fans.""</p><p>It's this sense of dedication that fuels songs such as Crop Comes In, a great showcase for the addition of drums to the band's usual all-string lineup. ""Yeah, so we have Zeke Hutchins (Tift Merritt, Sara Watkins, Hotel Lights) sitting there in the studio on a rare break from the road, so lets put him to work,"" Wilson explains. ""Though we're still going to tour as a four piece acoustic band, a record is something special, right?</p><p>A moment that lasts forever."" It's this feeling of an album as an encapsulated work of art that drives Wildwood for the listener. But where drums creep into the background of a few choice cuts, it's the acoustic roots of the band that really shine on the record. Evidenced in songs like Wildwood, Honeymoon, and especially Porcelain Doll--an ode to the children appearing in their midst. ""Yeah, all my friends have kids and car seats and diapers and can't go out on the weekends anymore,"" states Dave, ""so I put a song on there for them, 'cause I understand the beauty of that little life in your hands."" As for the future, CCL plans on touring extensively behind Wildwood over the next year as well as continuing to write the songs that got them this far. ""As long as they keep building vans and making ties,"" Dave says, ""we're gonna keep wearing them out.""</p><p>The band is currently on their never-ending tour, focusing on Wildwood as well as their previous four records. On the road they've been seen on the stages of festivals such as Merlefest, Grey Fox, Rockygrass, The Winnipeg Folk Fest, Pickathon, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, Shakori Hills, Bristol Rhythm and Roots, Pickin' in the Pines, 3 Sisters, Bergenfest (NO), Lowlands (NL), Take Root (NL), &amp; Kilkenny Rhythm and Roots (IE).

By fourteen, David was performing his own songs in folk clubs and having learned guitar, piano and drums in his childhood, it's not surprising to find he's mastered many of the instruments he uses on his recordings.</p><p>David founded Dire Straits, and with brother Mark recorded three albums, touring the stadium circuit extensively, before resigning three years later to follow his own path of independent, singer-songwriter. For more than two decades he's faithfully pursued his musical vision, writing and producing his own music on several critically acclaimed solo CDs.</p><p>David creates songs of substance. They are by turns deep and captivating, elegant and thought provoking, with clever, gripping lyrics, his exquisite sense of melody blending effortlessly. More attentive listeners might even find themselves decoding the frequent buried references David includes. An example is found in ""Jericho"" (from his 2002 album Wishbones), the words to which conceal titles of previous albums and songs.</p><p>David Knopfler has been fortunate enough to reach a wide audience without compromising his art. While he's enjoyed the respect and admiration of his musical peers, widespread critical acclaim, international awards and worldwide chart successes, he lives quietly in the English countryside, notching up an impressive list of writing credits.  An understated integrity and honesty define Knopfler in both his work and private life. A family man and a lifelong member of organizations like Greenpeace, Amnesty International and Adopt a Minefield, David has always made uncompromising life choices. ""I don't regard what I do as remotely glamorous. I write and record music because I completely love doing it, despite any so called ""celebrity status"" that sometimes comes with the job.""</p><p>David's first book of poetry entitled Blood Stones and Rhythmic Beasts was released in 2005 by Blackwing Books. The year 2006 saw the debut of his 10th CD ""Songs For the Siren"", and in March 2009 his collection ""Anthology:1983-2008"" was released.</p>",,,,,875,Antje Duvekot,,http://www.facebook.com/AntjeDuvekotMusic,http://www.youtube.com/user/AntjeDuvekotChannel/videos,http://www.antjeduvekot.com/,16760,"<p>""'New Siberia' is a special album to me because the songs are wiser,"" says songwriter Antje Duvekot.

That might not seem like a startling statement from most songwriters. But Duvekot is not most songwriters. For years, her songs have been critically praised for their hard-won wisdom, dark-eyed realism, and street-smart romanticism. Fans will certainly find all of that in 'New Siberia.'

Innovative, original and occasionally spiritual, Shindell's songs weave tales that interchangeably champion the downtrodden, exalt the disaffected or wax empathetic to those lost to society's fringes. From his first record, Sparrow's Point (1992) to the newest album Vuelta (2004), Shindell has demonstrated a penchant for songwriting at once passionate and profound. His songs are often slowly and painstakingly crafted until honed to perfection. Conversely, he is also capable of writing tunes that are simply clever and amusing.</p><p>Shindell's songwriting is truly eclectic, ranging from lighthearted ballads and adulterous love songs, to dirges and diatribes that skillfully skewer politics, prejudice, war and religion. He has a unique ability to morph into the soul of the many and varied personalities he casts as narrators in certain songs--songs that are veritable novellas framed in haunting acoustic melodies, sometimes including cryptic, revelations through the eyes of a woman.</p><p>Born in New Jersey, Mr. Shindell grew up in Port Washington, Long Island, where he began to take guitar lessons. He spent the last of his teenage years in Baltimore, then attended Hobart College in upstate New York, where he continued to pursue his musical interests. During an earlier stint at Moravian College, he teamed with John Gorka in the Razzy Dazzy Spasm Band.</p><p>Upon graduation, Shindell moved into a Zen Buddhist monastery for a while, leaving to explore Europe, and ending up the proverbial struggling musician in Paris, where he would often play for coins in the underground Metro train stations.</p><p>Leaving the city of light, Shindell found himself in New York, where he took a hiatus from music. Fascinated by philosophy and religion, he enrolled in Union Theological Seminary. Between classes, he began to write and finished what he calls his first ""keeper song,"" a melodic if cryptic ode to the Virgin Mary composed on the mountain dulcimer called ""On A Sea Of Fleur de Lis.""</p><p>Fortunately, it didn't take much to convince the New Jersey-based independent record label, Shanachie, that Mr. Shindell was a songwriter worth signing. Shindell produced three records under the Shanachie label, including Sparrow's Point (1992), Blue Divide (1994) and Reunion Hill (1997), which won the AFIM ""Best Contemporary Folk Album"" the following year in 1998.</p><p>With each successive record, Shindell toured relentlessly, and built a solid following of loyal fans. In 1997, he was invited to join Joan Baez on tour and opened the eyes and ears of a new segment of folk music enthusiasts to his talents as a songwriter and performer.</p><p>In 1998, Shindell formed the acoustic trio, Cry Cry Cry, with Dar Williams and Lucy Kaplansky. Along with a little help from their friends, Cry Cry Cry produced an eponymously titled album (Razor &amp; Tie Records) comprised largely of cover songs of lesser-known artists. The trio toured from 1998 until 2000, leaving audiences spellbound with their unique three-part harmonies.</p><p>In 2000, Shindell released Somewhere Near Patterson (Signature Sounds), which quickly became his most successful release to date. Produced by Larry Campbell, longtime member of the Bob Dylan Band, its release was followed by a comprehensive tour that played to sold-out shows across the country and established Shindell as one of the premier performing songwriters in popular music. Somewhere Near Patterson was followed by Courier, the live reprise of many of Shindell's best-loved songs.</p><p>Also in 2000, Shindell and his family moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he recorded Vuelta (Koch Records, 2004). For this project he joined up with Puente Celeste, a distinctly Argentine group of virtuouso musicians.</p><p>Now, Shindell returns north with an astonishing collection of covers called South of Delia.  To say that South of Delia is a record of covers, however, would not do justice to the spirit of this project.  It is a deeply personal choice of songs that Shindell offers up here - that of an expatriate looking back at the country he moved away from. With guest appearances by Lucy Kaplansky, Viktor Krauss, Richard Thompson, Tony Trischka, Eliza Gilkyson and others, South of Delia offers up new interpretations of songs such as Acadian Driftwood (Robbie Robertson), Seor (Bob Dylan), and  Deportee (Woody Guthrie). Shindell also thoroughly rehabilitates Springsteen;s often misunderstood Born in the USA.</p>",,,,,870,Alexa Ray Joel,http://www.myspace.com/alexarayjoel,,http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2488653940260996582,http://www.alexarayjoel.com,3408,"<p>Alexa Ray Joel is backstage at NYC's Hammerstein Ballroom, minutes away from taking the stage with her father, legendary singer/songwriter/pianist Billy Joel. While the night's event is a fundraiser for soon to be President-elect Barack Obama (with Bruce Springsteen sharing the bill) and there's been very little time to rehearse, Alexa is excited and confident. ""I've only performed with my dad twice,"" she offers, ""but I'm more comfortable performing with him than I am getting up there on my own."" She says this despite having more than one hundred shows of her own under her belt. ""People might think it's the other way around, but there's a real comfort in being on stage with him."" That evening, father and daughter perform ""Baby Grand,"" a song Billy wrote about his love for the piano. Alexa has lovingly rearranged the song as a vocal duet that she and her father can perform together. The capacity crowd loves it.</p><p>""People told me afterward that I held my own,"" she relates. ""To hear that I held my own with my father and Bruce Springsteen, to be able to be a part of that, is just amazing. To be received as an artist in the same light is very confidence-building to say the least. I felt very lucky to be able to be up there."" Moral support from her father aside, Alexa has never been one to ride on anyone's coattails. Since self-releasing her first EP in 2006, Alexa Ray Joel has embraced a DIY ethic and an almost old-fashioned musical aesthetic where everything flows from a well-written song, backed by a pitch-perfect and powerful voice. Without any label support or team of handlers, Alexa writes all of her own music, books her own shows and takes charge of any decisions affecting her career. She is an authentic artist with a distinct vision who is dedicated to being a live performer while having as much interaction with her fans as possible. Alexa Ray Joel is coming up fast, and she's doing things her own way.</p>",,,,,865,Gary Jules CD Release,,http://www.facebook.com/garyjulesmusic,http://www.garyjules.com/media/videos.php?p=46,http://www.garyjules.com,16448,"<p>""Falling Awake"", the first song from Gary Jules' independently released self-titled album appeared on two separate Billboard &lsquo;Top 100' charts in January 2007, one week after being heavily featured in an exceptionally popular episode of ""Grey's Anatomy"".When the editorial staff at Billboard learned that Jules' sales numbers were generated solely by iTunes downloads with no commercial radio airplay, record company, manager, publicist, publisher, radio or licensing agent to &lsquo;sell' the new album into the public eye, they wrote a full-page feature detailing Jules' unlikely rise to recognition with his album ""Trading Snakeoil for Wolftickets"" (featuring a cover of Tears for Fears' ""Mad World"") and the excitement surrounding the early success of his follow-up, ""Gary Jules"".</p><p>A live performance of ""Falling Awake"" on Last Call with Carson Daly on March 21st has sparked a scramble for worldwide physical release and international tour plans, and locked-up opening slots for Tears for Fears this summer. After years struggling in the nascent Los Angeles underground singer-songwriter scene of the mid-90's, Gary Jules' first record ""Greetings from the Side"" was recorded for A&amp;M Records and released in August 1998. Weeks later A&amp;M's parent label Polygram was bought by MCA/Universal. Jules and ""Greetings"" were lost in the proverbial shuffle, but not before both received considerable critical acclaim. Zeke Piestrup of VH-1's show ""Fresh"" called Jules ""The best American singer-songwriter to emerge out of the late '90's - and the only one worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence with Paul Simon, James Taylor, Cat Stevens and Nick Drake.""</p><p>In 2001 Jules' original independent release of ""Trading Snakeoil for Wolftickets,"" which included a cover of Tears For Fears' ""Mad World"" that Jules recorded with friend and producer Michael Andrews for the film ""Donnie Darko,"" arrived to even more critical acclaim. The Village Voice called it ""the best album to be released this year, anywhere. Period."" Rolling Stone Magazine said ""Trading Snakeoil for Wolftickets is at once beautiful and haunting, depressing and inspiring, lonely and welcoming - delicately crafted folk music of the highest order."" In October 2001, Richard Kelly's film ""Donnie Darko"" came out in theaters and quickly became a cult phenomenon. Not bad for an album created in a basement for less than $100.</p><p>In 2002 ""Snakeoil"" was championed by Nic Harcourt, host of ""Morning Becomes Eclectic"" at KCRW-FM in Los Angeles, and by Bruce Warren at WXPN-FM in Philadelphia. With these giants of listener-supported radio spreading the word, Jules toured constantly as an independent artist, sharing the stage with Jack Johnson, Damien Rice, Sheryl Crow, Beck, Mason Jennings, Jewel, Jason Mraz, The Polyphonic Spree, Liz Phair, and Todd Rundgren. His year-long residency at the then anonymous Hotel Cafe in Hollywood has become the stuff of legend in the new LA underground.</p><p>Jules also played more than 300 live shows from Summer 2003 through August 2004 in the US, Australia, UK and Europe, including a 3-week Summer &lsquo;04 run with Bob Dylan, from Ireland to Portugal. In 2006 Jules recorded his self-produced, and self-titled album, released it independently with longtime friends CdBaby.com, then left Los Angeles and moved to the mountains of Western North Carolina, where he is building a home studio and making plans for tours of the US, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fgary-jules%252Fid5670064%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/garyjulesmusic,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/0Az2BvTcshg"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/2Jh2RD8ULqI"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"863,The Scene Aesthetic,http://www.myspace.com/thesceneaesthetic,http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Scene-Aesthetic/63673303176?sid=14c98e4373b86feac3945ac9fb8d5feb&ref=s,http://www.youtube.com/thesceneaesthetic,,3248,"<p>It all started in Seattle in 2005 and could have ended shortly thereafter but unlike most overnight success stories the duo cut their teeth with each new experience and voyaged forward recording and writing.

Just look at the recent track record: From Russell Crowe to Lindsey Lohan ... well, let's just say it hasn't been a very pretty sight. Thanks to those people and others (We're looking at you, Kevin Bacon), any actor who wants an honest shot at a career in music has a long, dark road ahead of him.</p><p>Fortunately for all of us, ""actor-turned-musician"" Thomas Ian Nicholas has two weapons in his corner. First, he's been playing music for over half his life and can write a pop song like nobody's business. And second, that long road we were talking about? Doesn't bother him one bit.</p><p>Thom has been, is, and to some degree will always be known as Kevin from the ""American Pie"" movies. That's right, he was that nice kid, that wholesome kid ... that kid who got to make out with Tara Reid. Whereas to most young men the idea of living with that identity is not such a bad proposition, Nicholas has the desire, not to mention the talent, to be so much more.</p><p>""I didn't really get pigeonholed with that film. I didn't do the pie. I didn't do my friend's mom,"" he laughs.</p><p>""So the idea that people know me from &lsquo;American Pie' is a positive thing. Any sort of success that I have achieved in my career as an actor, it's a total blessing,"" he adds, ""but right now, music is my passion, and I'm putting a lot of hard work into making that a reality.""</p><p>Which brings us to the present day, mere months away from the release of Nicholas' debut album, Without Warning (released nationwide on January 15, 2008). It's an upbeat, ""O.C.""-worthy album of pop-rock filled with more hooks than a bait shop. It features collaborations with rock legends like Bruce Kulick (KISS), Chris Chaney (Jane's Addiction) and John Corabi (M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e). And it could melt the hearts of today's TRL-loving teens faster than you can say, ""John Mayer.""</p><p>Musically, Thom draws from a solid crop of influences - from Switchfoot to Springsteen - that have helped him learn the art of writing a pop song while keeping a foot in rock and roll. His music is polished enough to swagger right onto the radio, but raw enough to sound honest - and, it's worth mentioning, is much more rock and roll than you'd ever expect from someone who's had the dubious honor of being tagged Seventeen Magazine's ""It Boy.""</p><p>""When it comes to the lyric side, I aspire to be one-tenth of John Mayer. His lyrics are unbeatable,"" Thom says. ""I also side with the Beatles, only in the sense that I'm a big fan of cool melody lines and changes that are unexpected.

Childhood friends Adam Smith (guitar) and Matt Santoro (vocals) formed the band, under the name ""bob"" in &lsquo;05 with the vision of bringing something fresh to a rock scene that seemed to have forgotten what rock n roll was really about. Soon after, they added Drew Recny (bass) and Chris Faircloth (drums). This band breathes rebellious authenticity back into music and reminds you that rock music is supposed to make you get up and not give a damn about being you.</p><p>When you see SUPER bob live your senses will be overwhelmed by a borderline excess of stage presence and heart pounding sound. P.R.S sponsored guitarist Adam Smith brings a package of uniqueness, flare, and pure adrenaline that is rarely found in any one musician, while classically trained Drew Recny packs a clean, punchy bass style that is loaded with obvious talent and a technique that only comes with full dedication and commitment to his craft. Christopher Faircloth, a Spaun Drum Company sponsored drummer, brings an almost indescribable style to the table, one with high flying stick tricks, and hard pounding, ear deafening, strong beats. The proverbial icing on the SUPER bob cake is provided by Matt Santoro's vocals which can only be described as unabashedly his own. Full of ear catching melodies, unapologetic and blatantly honest lyrics, and a flow that is uncommon yet undeniably at home in rock, Santoro's songwriting couples with an unrivaled stage presence that caps off one of the best live bands you will ever get the chance to experience.</p><p>SUPER bob's buzz was established with their eye catching live shows, non-stop hustle, and no excuses work ethic. Tattoos, colored hair, dread locks, and plenty of good old fashioned rock n roll grit distinguishes them from the undedicated and identifies them as the real deal in an industry riddled with fakers. After three years of hard work at gaining recognition, winning the loyalty of fans in their local scene, and growing a fan-base across the Mid-Atlantic, SUPER bob hooked up with Grammy nominated producer Garth ""GGGarth"" Richardson. They went to Vancouver BC to record their first full length record entitled ""bbbob"" and then hit the road for the next three years playing an average of 130 shows annually over a span of 19 states.</p><p>""I have seen over 7,500 bands in the last fifteen years, and SUPER bob is one of the best.

""The garage dated back to the 1940s. It had concrete floors and tall ceilings,"" says Burch. ""It gave everything we recorded a natural echo and a lot of personality. We could make the music sound like it was coming from a ballroom, a juke joint, or a taxi driving through Times Square."" A fan of engineers Tom Dowd (Atlantic Records) and Sam Phillips (Sun Records), Burch had been searching for a place to record that would give his music a sonic signature. ""I have found that sometimes the best place to make music is outside of a proper studio. I wanted everything to feel good--performance over perfection.""</p><p>PB produced the 13 original songs on 'Still Your Man,' along with a cover of Little Walter's ""It Ain't Right,"" with WPA bassist and Robert Plant &amp; Alison Krauss bandleader Dennis Crouch along with former Jayhawk, Jen Gunderman. The album also features guest performers Kelly Hogan (Neko Case) and Tim O'Brien. ""The WPA is something like a rock n' roll version of Charles Mingus' groups,"" Burch comments. ""It's a collective  and a workshop for musicians who have an individual style. I don't often tell them what we're going to do and that little bit of edge allows me to take chances...""</p><p>...Burch's ear for producing and arranging has made him a natural collaborator to many legendary musicians who otherwise would never see themselves together on the same list including Ralph Stanley, Lambchop, Mark Knopfler, the Waco Brothers, British R&amp;B diva Beverly Knight, and the Grammy nominated comeback by legend Charlie Louvin. Burch also served as music consultant to the PBS documentary ""The Appalachians"" and wrote a soundtrack to Tony Earley's debut novel and NY Times bestseller ""Jim the Boy"".</p><p>It's an impressive list of accomplishments that defies category and that's all right with Paul who himself is a category yet to be named. Critics have praised Burch's ""music that sounds thoroughly modern but completely unlike contemporary country"" (USA Today) and Entertainment Weekly has called him ""a modern day Jimmie Rodgers"". The comparison isn't too far off if you take into account Rodger's groundbreaking blend of disparate styles and collaborations with legends from jazz (Louis Armstrong) to country (Carter Family).</p><p>""For some people music goes very deep, and I hope my music reaches that place for them,"" comments Paul, ""but I also hope my sound has something for those who haven't heard music speak to them yet.""</p>",,,,,839,Punch Drunk Poets,http://www.myspace.com/punchdrunkpoets,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Punch-Drunk-Poets/100340730952?ref=ts,,http://punchdrunkpoets.com,0,"<p>Punch Drunk Poets ""PDP"" is a DC-based alternative rock quartet with a soulful yet psychedelic approach to rock. With a fresh approach to lyric-writing and an ear for eclectically melodic and rhythmic tunes, these nouveau feel-rock pioneers are building a completely new sound that still manages to be reminiscent of the glory days of songwriting and music. The band can certainly be described as having an original sound. Intricate rhythm and lead sections mixed with lyrics addressing subjects of depth and philosophical introspection, as well as fictional stories with humorous connotations will fulfill your musical desires.</p><p>In March 09, after two years under the radar and an intense creative cycle, PDP released its debut album ""Another State of Mind"", produced by industry-veteran Jim Ebert (Butch Walker, Meredith Brooks, Cowboy Mouth, Marvelous 3, Niki Barr). The album is a refreshingly eclectic palette of rock, sporting raw poetic ballads in the traditions of Jeff Buckley and The Doors as well as raucous hard rock in the spirit of Soundgarden and The Red Hot Chili Peppers.</p><p>Having released their first album, PDP now is poised to build upon its live presence in the music scene as well as mastering the art of creating a sound of depth and accessibility by listeners. The band is currently engaged in yet another extensive creative cycle in preparation for a sophomore album, and gearing up for a small east-coast tour.</p>",,,,,837,Jukebox Serenade,http://www.myspace.com/jukeboxserenade,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jukebox-Serenade/105161147968,,,12053,"<p>Jukebox Serenade, formerly Ringleader, will release it's full-length CD ""Bliss"".

Talking with her about the passionate swirl of her debut release, Love Travels, the 21 year-old singer-songwriter is quick to share stories about her inspirations, but those stories fast become secondary to the true magic of her talent as a songwriter: The 12 tracks on Love Travels are more than just personal missives that Angel Taylor has set to music, they are living and breathing experiences that we have all shared. The names may change, but the stories remain the same.</p><p>""Anyone who has ever wanted to be loved very deeply by someone, but hasn't, will totally be able to grab hold of these songs,"" says Taylor. ""That's what this album is about - wanting it so bad, not having it, and wondering why... It's a lot of questions.""</p><p>And while Taylor doesn't pretend to have any answers, there's no escaping how good it feels to get engulfed by her insecurities, romanced by her vulnerability, and swooned by her tender lyrics and swaying melodies. Feeling self-conscious about listening to love songs written by a girl barely removed from her teens? Try and remember when love hurt the most, that high school spark that never flickered into a flame, or the flame that fanned out as quickly as it flared, making everything around you ache and throb. In a lot of ways, the love Angel Taylor is writing about is the most pure, untainted by a lifetime of experiences that too often devour the idealism of the helpless romantic buried in us all.</p>",,,,,833,TODD WRIGHT & FRIENDS: A Retrospective featuring members of the Excentrics,http://www.myspace.com/orangepopsongs,http://www.facebook.com/orangepopsongs,,http://orangepopsongs.com/,11656,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Singer-songwriter Todd Wright spent the early part of this century with his band GetawayCar who's song ""Superstar"" was the soundtrack for the 2003 Pontiac Vibe. The band had to turn down the opening slot at the legendary HFStival in their hometown of Washington, DC when Todd landed a gig playing guitar with then-Atlantic Recording Artist Lucy Woodward. He spent most of 2003 with Lucy promoting her debut album ""While You Can"" in the US, Japan and New Zealand. From 2004-2006 Todd was the touring keyboardist/guitarist with the Pat McGee Band in support of their Warner Brothers release ""Save Me."" In addition to these artists Todd has been a fill in guitarist for Sony/Or artist Adam Richman and Better Than Ezra.</p><p>In late 2006 Wright left the touring world to join forces with songwriter Scott Simons. Their instant chemistry as a writing team produced a batch of songs that got them signed to World's End Management within months of their first collaboration. In addition to Simons/Wright Todd produced and co-wrote the Pat McGee Band's last album ""These Days-The Virginia Sessions"" and has been writing with, producing and developing the DC-based beyond-her-years teen singer Chelsea Lee. In 2008 Wright signed to Warner Chappell music publishing and has written songs with artists on Verve, Epitaph, Atlantic and Motown/Universal.</p><p>In 2010 Wright signed with Pen music publishing and has since placed songs on TV shows Bones (FOX) and One Tree Hill (CW) as well as an upcoming major motion picture called What's Your Number. In his 39th year Wright completed a project called 40x40 where he wrote and released a song every week for 40 weeks culminating on his 40th birthday. The project was participated in by many of Todd's musical buds including members of Collective Soul, Better Than Ezra, The New York Dolls and Taylor Swift's band.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mark Williams and Justin Sheehy are two founding members of the rootsy  pop rock band Jonasay, who's 2001 Album ""Spare Dimes For Dust"" was met  with critical acclaim and earned the band a sizeable regional and  Midwest following.  They were amongst the first bands to perform at  Jammin Java, and they played the JJ stage for several years to sold-out  audiences.  The band went their separate ways in 2004, but Mark and  Justin continued to remain close and keep the creative fire burning.   Justin moved to Los Angeles, where he currently lives, to pursue  writing, performing and producing.  Mark established Sucker Punch  Recording Co., a fantastic recording studio in Bethesda, MD, where he  produces, mixes and does session work.  Mark has been fortunate to be in  demand as a session and live player in the area also performing with  Todd Wright and Taylor Carson.   Mark and Justin have been working on  new songs for the past several years and are excited to finally be close  to releasing new record.  The band's name, ""West Goes East"", reflects  the process of Justin traveling from L.A. to Bethesda to work on the  record  with Mark.  Songs will be played from the new record, as well as  classics from the Jonasay days.</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/todd-wright/id402515994?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/#!/orangepopsongs,,831,The Hip-Hop Against Human Trafficking Tour w/ Flex Mathews,http://www.myspace.com/flexmathews,,,,0,"<p>Flex Mathews has tour and performed with: Lupe Fiasco, Army of Me, Atmosphere, KRS-One (Twice), Big Daddy Kane, Gang Starr, Camp Lo, Biz Markie, Das EFX, The Wu-Tang Clan, Special Ed, Non-Phixion, The Beatnuts, RA The Ruggid Man, J-Live, Tame-One, Asharu and Blue Black, Kev Brown, Oddisee, Master Ace, MC Chris, The Clipse, Roc Radia, Glue, Hangar 18, Pete Rock, Talib Kweli (twice), Percee P, Mad Skillz, Slick Rick, Killah Priest, The Roots, The Lords of Brooklyn, Yazarah, BreezEvaflowin, Poison Pen, Immortal Technique, Bahmadia, Copy Write, Icon The Mic King, C-Rays Wallz, Mr.Lif Cannibal Ox, and even Vanilla Ice.</p><p>In 2005 Flex Mathews was part of the entertainment portion of the Take Back America Campaign - warming the stage for such greats like Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Kerry, and more.</p><p>Flex Mathews is a 2x Guerrilla Grammar Battle Champion, and 3x Tru Skool Rip The Mic Battle Champion, 2x Kool Cigarettes Battle Champion (that he now regrets), and a 8x H.E.R Battle Champion to name a few.

Erik's melodies touch the hearts and souls of his fans. His dexterity and the complexity of his compositions, rendering them difficult to imitate, have attracted the attention and adulation of some of the world's ��_��nest musicians. He astonished guitar legend Paul Reed Smith (PRS Guitars) who, after building a custom acoustic guitar for Erik, showed one of Erik's videos to none other than Paul McCartney (The Beatles), who also fell in love with the unique musician.</p><p>A single video (Airtap!) on Youtube was enough to earn Erik two contracts to score ��_��lms. In April of 2008, Japanese National Television (NHK) landed in Montreal in order to introduce Erik Mongrain's exceptional acoustic guitar talents to the Japanese population. Many have hailed him as one of the great acoustic guitar players, along with Michael Hedges and Pierre Bensuzan. Erik meticulously composes songs, each more harmonious than the last. His delightful music is captivating.</p><p>Following Fates, the Montreal-base guitarist now releases his sophomore album Equilibrium, which includes guest artists Michael Manring and Bill Plummer.

As a prolific artist-producer, his catalog reflects an ever-evolving experiment with sounds and styles, fusing his pop sensibility with soul, electro, and rock. His songs are arguably among the most memorable in the history of music, winning the hearts of music fans and industry insiders alike. An ASCAP composer and publisher, Minh also holds a voting membership with The Recording Academy, home of The Grammy.</p><p>Born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, he immigrated to the DC area with his family when he was 9 years old. He had already started writing poems by that age and began writing songs by the age of 13. In middle school, he penned a song that would be sung by his school's choir during their annual Christmas concert. This and winning some talent competitions during his early school days were tell-tale signs of what is to come.</p><p>However, at the age of 14, any potential was nearly destroyed when he became a part of a black hood gang and started dealing crack cocaine on the streets where he lived. A bad drug deal that took place after a friend tricked him into selling fake crack led to his self-imposed exile to keep from getting killed. During this time, he was invited to church by a friend and the experience there would turn his life around. After graduating high school, he spent several years helping organize outreaches and campaigns to help those in need while also doing both music and speaking in youth groups, events, and even in state and federal penitentiaries across the country. Entrepreneurial at heart, Minh founded his own marketing and entertainment company in 2004, today known as Minh Unlimited.</p><p>In 2005, he began exploring a career in music, performing at open mics while producing music in his home project studio. This resulted in his first self-produced album, ""Life.Love.Soul."", which was released in early 2006. However, being dissuaded from entering the music industry by a mentor, he put it off all the while continuing to privately produce as a hobby.</p><p>It wasn't until 2010 that Minh began his career with the release of ""Dreamgirl's Heart"", a full-length electro-soul album which served as a primer for his push into the industry.  Within a few months of its release in February 2010, Minh landed a film/tv licensing contract for that album with Hella Good Records out of Los Angeles, CA.</p><p>Minh quickly followed it up with the release of ""Layers"", another full-length album, in October 2010. At this point, his music began attracting the attention of music industry executives. Continuing to build his career, he released two more singles before the year's end from an upcoming album, ""The Shape of You"". Before the album was ever released, two singles got licensed by ShowRunner Music, a company co-founded by highly sought-after MTV music supervisor and producer, Jon Ernst, for placement in films and tv.</p><p>Now with the release of his fourth studio album, ""The Shape of You"", in March 2011, Minh is proving to a skeptical industry just how prolific he is as a writer/producer and how capable he is of charting sustainable success in the new music era. In this changing world of music and entertainment, Minh is the artist, producer, and entrepreneur to follow as he continues to make his mark in his own way. His music speaks for itself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,803,Girl Authority,,,,http://www.girlauthority.com,2589,"<p>Girl Authority is a group of real girls with different personalities and interests coming together to sing, dance and put their own spin on girl power pop hits you know and love.</p><p>It's the hottest musical party in town, and every girl is invited!</p><p>Come as you are and get ready to have a blast!

Although SBH seem to weave together super-smart arrangements and unforgettable melodies with the greatest of ease, they would've likely never made it out of Little Rock were it not for the tireless efforts of the group's members.

Considering how infectious SBH's music truly is, there's no level of success outside of the realm of possibility.&nbsp; The band has recently released a NEW song, entitled, ""7 Minutes in Heaven"".

The new and improved Rookie of the Year debuted in the spring of 2006 with The Goodnight Moon.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""></span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL_YOS0aWsA""></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">Fourth Quarter Comeback</span> <span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.fourthquartercomeback.com/"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/4thquarterband"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/4thquartercomeback"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/FourthQuarterComeback"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Ffourth-quarter-comeback%252Fid449156079%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/4QCMusic"">youtube</a></span></h4><p>Formed during the summer of 2010, Fourth Quarter Comeback hit the gates at a sprint, recording their debut EP Album, ""Finders Keepers"" with producer Jim Ebert (All Time Low, Butch Walker) shortly after solidifying themselves as a group. Andy, Ben and Casey, despite not yet having a drummer, were able to write and record the type of music they knew they wanted to play: driving, energetic, uplifting Power-Pop, and Jim had a unique vision for where they could take their style of sound. Drummer Matt DuRousseau joined shortly afterward in the Fall of 2010, and as a band they debuted electronically in late January of 2011 with presence on Facebook, Myspace, Purevolume, Youtube, Twitter and their own website (www.fourthquartercomeback.com). With their eyes on success, the bar has been set for Fourth Quarter Comeback to jump into the Pop-Rock scene with an enormous amount of vigor and intensity; something they have definitely not fallen short of. One can only speculate as to what the future holds for this promising band, but with continued support from fans and positive feedback to their music, the sky is the limit.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""></span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/4QCMusic""></a></p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fschool-boy-humor%252Fid294477627%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/SCHOOLBOYHUMOR,,794,1000 Watt Boombox,,,,,0,,,,,,792,Escape the Armada,http://www.myspace.com/escapethearmada,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Escape-The-Armada/11543609873?ref=mf,,,0,,http://www.purevolume.com/escapethearmada,,,,789,Ben Rudnick & Friends,,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImF7z7qM3a0&feature=channel_page,http://www.benrudnick.com,3620,"<p><strong><a href=""http://www.zooglobble.com"" target=""_blank"">Zooglobble Recommended!</a>: ""'Hey, you got kids music in my jam band!

Since Ben Rudnick and Friends original songs aren't overtly children's music, and enthusiastic renditions of well known songs appeal to all, everyone in the audience from the oldest to the youngest become involved in the excitement of the moment.

Playing incognito, there were rumours the Pork Dukes featured Keith Moon on vocals, members of Led Zeppelin, The Rezillos, Tenpole Tudor, Steeleye Span and even Dudley Moore. Only some of this was true.</p><p>The Pork Dukes released their first single &lsquo;Bend &amp; Flush' in the heady summer of 1977, and the rude content and cover of the single helped it sell over 20,000 copies.</p><p>Although the notorious Pork Dukes had three UK ind ie hit singles and two album releases, they received no radio airplay. That's not surprising, because the band offended society with sexy song titles, like: Throbbing Gristle, Making Bacon, My Mother Gave Me A Gun For Xmas, I Like Your Big Tits, Let's See If It Fits, and Telephone Masturbator.</p><p>The late, legendary UK DJ John Peel, on his Radio One show, remarked that ""the Pork Dukes would have hits with their infuriating catchy singles, were they not so manifestly unbroadcastable!""</p><p>But even a nod of approval from Elton John at the time didn't help: the curiosity surrounding the Pork Dukes afforded them cult status but after releasing two albums the band split in 1979.</p><p>In the last few years since the band has reformed, three re-released albums have been followed swiftly by a new single, mostly featuring artwork by the renowned UK low-brow fetish artist Vince Ray. The single, &lsquo;Pop Stars', was produced by Kid Krupa, the guitarist from 1970s band The Revillos, shortly before he sadly passed away. And now the band's merchandise - designed by UK low-brow fetish artist Vince Ray - has become very collectible.</p><p>The band have also made several trips to the USA where they have a strong cult following.  They have toured in areas such as New York , Las Vegas, Florida, Phoenix, and Philadephia.  They have yet to play in California so this would be the first time for them!</p><p>Clearly, since the heady days of punk a number of people could lay claim to being the rudest singer/band. But no-one does it with the panache, humour and fun of the Pork Dukes. The band has a tongue-in-cheek, punk-fuelled sing-a-long live act that captures the imagination of both sexes - providing you're open-minded and like a good laugh, because the Pork Dukes were aural sex.

""Most people don't really say they're happy about a Monday, they view it like it's the first day of the rest of their week, but Monday can also just be a new beginning...""</p><p>Barely out of high school, Cassadee's new beginning is a dream come true. Discovered at a regional music conference where the teenage siren would sing for anyone willing to listen, she attracted the attention of record label scouts at a time when most of her friends weren't even old enough to drive. Less than two years later she's preparing for the release of her band's first album, Hold On Tight, a joint venture between Columbia Records and Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz's Decaydance Records. Produced by S*A*M and Sluggo [The Academy Is, Gym Class Heroes, Metro Station], the album is a free-spirited spin through life's post-adolescent twists, turns, trials and triumphs.</p><p>""We have a variety of styles, but they're all pretty-much fast and upbeat, because we wanted a fast, upbeat and happy kind of record that makes you tap your feet and puts you in a good mood,"" explains Cassadee. ""There are heartbroken songs, being in love songs, a song about someone who parties too much... If it's not all about me, then it's about someone very close to me who I can feel for. I just wanted to tell a story, to make it like a movie where you can really get to know someone.

Sproule's songs are something to behold:  Victoria Williams' playfulness and spunk meeting up with Joni Mitchell's confessional songwriting chops. To top it off, this is the sexiest, sultriest southern album since Lucinda's Car Wheels on a Gravel Road."" <em>-Paste</em></p><p>""The nimble singer-guitarist Devon Sproule chronicles her ongoing love affairs with humanity, nature, and the state of Virginia. She performs with a sweet, round diction that shines through even her most ornate imagery and rambunctious melodies."" <em>-New Yorker</em></p><p>""Infectious Appalachian stomp with jazz shadings.  Sproule's voice is an elastic instrument of old-school soul, recalling anyone from Sara Carter to Patsy Cline."" <em>-Uncut</em></p><p>Though she seems to spend more time in Europe these days, Ms. Sproule still calls Charlottesville, Virginia home.  Her newest collection of songs, Don't Hurry for Heaven, produced by songwriter and husband Paul Curreri and featuring a cameo by fellow-Virginian Jesse Winchester, will be released by Black Hen Records in the US and Canada on March 16th.  Already released in the UK, Don't Hurry for Heaven was given four stars by both Mojo (""what storytelling is all about"") and Uncut Magazine (""lacing folk, country and swing into an gorgeously inviting whole"").</p><p>Sproule's previous effort, 2007's Keep Your Silver Shined was called ""The sexiest, sultriest southern album since Lucinda's ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"" by Paste Magazine and featured singing from another Virginia-native, Mary Chapin Carpenter.  Supporting the record, Sproule toured with Woodstock legend Richie Havens, Lambchop frontman Kurt Wagner, and supported back-to-back nights in London with Lucinda Williams.  Sproule's breakout record, Upstate Songs, was included in Rolling Stone's Critics Top Albums of 2003. She was the first American to grace the cover of fRoots in the new millennium, and her appearance on England's trend-setting Later...With Jools Holland cocked the ears of fans and industry alike, informing them that yes, her surname does indeed rhyme with ""rock &lsquo;n roll.""</p>",,,,,746,The Waybacks,,,,http://www.waybacks.com,0,"<p>They draw freely from the old school and the old world, but The Waybacks are no throwback. They've been erroneously pigeonholed as a bluegrass band and celebrated as purveyors of ""acoustic mayhem."" They are as uninhibited and unpredictable as the eclectic San Francisco Bay area that claims them, and for nearly a decade, their experiments have always proven sharp-witted and musically dazzling. They're living proof that in music anyway, evolution and intelligent design are entirely compatible. ""The whole spirit of improvisation - that's always been the cornerstone of this band for me,"" says founding singer, songwriter and guitarist James Nash. ""Through all the stylistic changes and regardless of the instruments we're playing, to me the fun of this band has always been that in some ways I can do whatever I feel like doing at any moment.""</p><p>They've been through changes for sure. Now a four-piece with a full arsenal of acoustic and electric instruments, The Waybacks released Loaded in 2008, the boldest, rangiest and most exciting album of their career. Produced by Nashville bassist, composer and consummate sideman Byron House, it's a musical rebuke to anyone who would typecast true artistry.</p><p>The folk and roots underpinnings that have long been a Waybacks hallmark are still there, but after years of playing a huge range of venues and festivals, touring with Grateful Dead founder Bob Weir, and reconfiguring themselves around the hot guitar of James Nash and the fiddle virtuosity of Warren Hood, The Waybacks are enjoying a refreshed repertoire - one that's touched by Memphis soul, honky-tonk, Parisian swing, classical music, vintage blue pop and much more besides. Nash and Hood have stepped forward as songwriters, allowing The Waybacks to assemble their first project of entirely original music. They're finding a new collective voice, right before our ears.</p>",http://www.waybacks.com/merch.html,,,,744,King of the Beltway 3,,,,http://www.kingofthebeltway.com,6289,"<p>Inner Loop Records and National Producers League Presents: King of the Beltway 3</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Host: </strong></p><p>Fort Knox</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Judges:</strong></p><p>Celebrity judges to be announced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About: </strong></p><p>The King of the Beltway is the DMV's version of a hip hop producers battle for the throne.

Songs like the focus track ""Let's Go"" reflect Madi's lifelong attraction to song craft as well a deep-rooted affinity for contrasting types of music.  One part pop music and one part organic Americana, the album is a hooky, confident collection of songs that is as heartbreaking in places as it is catchy in others, sometimes within the span of a single song. <br /> <br />The Nashville-based musician is herself a bit of a contrast, growing up in Lancaster, PA, surrounded by Amish farms.  In her early teens, she landed at the School of Rock in Philadelphia, where she was a standout student and focal point of director Don Argott's 2005 documentary.   Shortly thereafter, she attended Berklee College of Music where she met long time writing collaborator Kyle Ryan. The pair moved to Nashville and quickly catapulted into the center of the city's nascent indie-pop scene, with Madi's songs gaining major exposure through television placements, such as on ABC Family's ""Pretty Little Liars"" and Lifetime's ""Drop Dead Diva"" and ""Army Wives"" and garnering press with major outlets like <a href=""http://rollingstone.com/"" target=""_blank"">RollingStone.com</a>, Teen Vogue, Marie Claire, and Nylon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Compared to Joni Mitchell and Patti Griffin by NPR -- Lucy Schwartz as born in NYC into an influential musical family.

If you like catchy pop hooks and lots of vocal harmonies, the WD Miller Band will hook you.</p><p>In November 2006, WD Miller released his second CD, Whirly Town.  With the formation of the WD Miller Band, he has assembled a crack unit that generates great pop songs and high energy shows. The group has been performing to packed clubs around Northern VA, including Bangkok Blues (Falls Church), Jammin Java (Vienna), and Iota (Arlington).</p><p>WD Miller, a home-grown Virginia boy, was weaned on the jangle guitars and harmonies of 60s pop and 70s California pop. Influences include Beatles, Beach Boys, Zombies, Tommy James, America, Bread, Eagles. WD started writing songs over 20 years ago, and has over 250 compositions to his credit.  He has recorded two solo CDs, Sugarland Run (2000) and Whirly Town (2006). WD writes, sings, and plays rhythm guitar. He has recorded with a handful of local musicians, including Mike Melchione (Buckwheat Zydeco), Scott Shuman (Jackson St. Band, Henry Townsend Band), Kai Kapitano (Lost Highway Band), Bill Kotopish (Code Blue), Jim Opeka, Mickey Blue, Mark Kelley, Mike Johns, Mike Kelley, and James Manion (James and the Flames). The WD Miller Band started up after recruiting musicians for the Whirly Town CD release party; the boys in the band wanted to keep going!</p>",,,,,730,I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business,http://www.myspace.com/aceendersandamilliondifferentpeople,http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/pages/Ace-Enders-and-a-million-different-people/112013395614,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HQ9gqMPGbQ,,9745,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Early Show!</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.<br /><br /></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ace Enders' prolific career spanning over a decade continues with the release of the third album from his band I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business, titled Gold Rush out on May 5th.  The southern New Jersey based singer/songwriter and frontman of the now defunct cult favorite indie band The Early November is a completely independent artist, without a label or manager for the first time in ten years, which surprisingly has ignited more opportunities than ever for the 28-year-old family man.  Enders, along with his wife and business partner Jenn, has launched a grassroots network of 200 interns in communities around the world to fulfill the functions of a small label staff with the goal of creating a new business model for other independent bands to do the same.</p><p>The new model supports the very organic intentions of Enders as an artist and further encourages and motivates him to create music that represents and cultivates the close relationship he has with his supporters.  In fact, when Ace was unsure about his ability to continue his career in music, his fans rose to the occasion to help and inspire him to keep going, making him realize that a network like the internship program was both possible and necessary in the music industry.  The support has gone so far as to fund the upcoming release through a Kickstarter campaign, which raised over $30,000, tripling the original goal and allowing plans for the next release to flourish through the new internship program.</p><p>The internship is aimed at channeling the connection between fans and artists to create a mutually beneficial partnership and rebuild the respect that has been lost through an over-saturated market and rampant free downloading.  Within the program, the band receives the assistance needed with promotion, publicity, marketing, design, and more while the interns gain experience in the music industry and the very real potential to become part of the band's paid staff.  The new model will begin functioning within the soon to be launched website, soundofevolution.com, a social and professional network that serves as an umbrella of support for the bands who will follow Enders' grassroots practices.</p><p>I Can Make a Mess will embark on a three week Pick What You Pay headlining tour in May, giving the attendees the chance to choose their own ticket prices, as a way to further the relationship of respect between fan and artist. Enders also plans to tour this fall in support of the new record and the documentary film that showcases the process of his new business model and the history of his career, with the hope of bundling speaking engagements about the music industry on college campuses, documentary showings, and music performances into the shows.</p><p>I Can Make a Mess is thrilled to be working with the humanitarian-based fashion brand, Jedidiah, who uses apparel sales as a vehicle to provide support, care and financial resources to those in need. Jedidiah has made it possible for the band to mirror the Pick What You Pay model of the tour for the sale of merchandise.  Fans will be able to choose a price for a shirt at the shows, starting at just $10.  The band will also support Jedidiah in their partnership with Stand Up For Kids, an outreach organization dedicated to making a difference in the lives of at-risk, homeless street kids.</p><p>Ace Enders will be raffling off the guitar that he will play each night on the Pick What You Pay Tour to raise money for Stand Up For Kids.  Every shirt purchase of $20 will enter fans to win and single raffle tickets will also be sold for $5.  All money raised will go to Stand Up For Kid's effort to open a center in New York City.  ""It's amazing to work with Jedidiah.  They truly want to help people just like we do, so it feels really great to be involved with them.  And they make some really great clothing on top of being great people,"" says Enders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://www.aceenders.com/media.html#http://www.imeem.com/aceenders,,,,728,Yorrelle,http://www.myspace.com/yorrelle,,,http://www.wix.com/alvinev123/Yorrelle,2353,"<p>Blessed with an angelic yet powerhouse voice, Yorrelle's freshman CD project release ""Feels Like Love"" features a beautiful collection of thoughtful songs that takes a look at a love for God, loving relationships, and a genuine love for oneself.

Much of that is because of the relationship the group has with its fans. It usually starts in small clubs or even backyards in their hometown, then spreads to nearby cities, neighboring states and soon across entire regions, until the band finally comes into its own as a national presence.</p><p>The Benjy Davis Project is poised to take on that presence. They've spent the past seven years building fan strongholds around the U.S., releasing three albums that capture their unique force. Davis's songs speak to the ability of music to move an audience, as seen in countless nights of touring and performing. There comes a point in a breakthrough band's career where they finally turn that corner into greatness. With the release November 4th on Rock Ridge Music of the Benjy Davis Project's album, ""Dust,"" this Baton Rouge, Louisiana-based band now moves into that moment.</p><p>""I want to reach people and hopefully touch them in some way."" That's how Benjy Davis describes his mission, and music is his medium. It's always been that way for him, since he was a young teenager in Louisiana, listening to everything on the radio, taking it all in until it would be his time to step up and become an artist. He formed the Benjy Davis Project in 2001, which began as a simple folk-rock duo but soon grew into one of the most popular bands in Baton Rouge. Eventually expanding into a six-piece group, the Project has recorded three albums prior to ""Dust,"" each a big leap from the one before, and played across the country as headliners and support act on shows with John Mayer, Better Than Ezra, North Mississippi All-Stars and others, as well as events like the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival. All this experience has brought them to that place where they can become the next band to take their Southern-based sound to a new level of national popularity.</p>",,,,,722,The Maybe List,,,,,0,,,,,,721,McTwist CD Release,http://www.myspace.com/mctwistrock,,,,7968,"<p>McTwist formed in summer of 2007, sharing a love of music, performing, road trips, sports and video games.

This experience during their formative years enabled the band to gain valuable stage experience while experimenting with a wide variety sounds. McTwist loves to put on a show. Their mix of humor and music is present in everything they do. Since their inception, McTwist has developed an unyielding work ethic, an unmistakable sound, and a dedicated fan base.</p><p>With their highly anticipated sophomore effort, ""Ifs, Ands, or Butts,""  McTwist is excited about continuing to grow as musicians and as people. The album is an exemplar of what makes McTwist distinctive: powerful guitars, exceptional harmonies, and a driving rhythm section. They play a brand of rock that is dedicated to being true to their wide-ranging influences, drawing equally from all genres, ranging from Motown to modern pop. McTwist is as comfortable sweating and jumping through a two-hour electric performance, as they are entering into a songwriter's circle and completely stripping down their music.

The Great Pretend, Kid Architect's first full length album, was released in December 2010. The album is a concept album that focuses on the themes of struggling to find truth, clinging to ones beliefs, and finding meaning in a modern age when everything seems to be generally accepted and unquestioned. ""The 16-track journey stays true to the Kid Architect sound, driven by heavy pianos, swirling guitar textures, complex rhythmic elements, and a lead singer who is both infectious and clever in his vocal deliveries.

But the sophisticated jazz- and blues-influenced guitar licks Taylor added to such classic albums as Sticky Fingers gave the Stones an added dimension they lacked before and after him.</p><p>Michael Kevin Taylor was born Jan. 17, 1949, in Welwyn Garden City, England. He grew up in Hatfield, a London suburb, and began playing guitar at age 9. Taylor became interested in joining a rock band after his parents took him to see Bill Haley &amp; the Comets.</p><p>As a teen, Taylor played in bands called the Juniors and the Gods. In 1967, after ace guitarist Peter Green left John Mayall's Bluesbreakers to form Fleetwood Mac, Mayall chose Taylor as Green's replacement.</p><p>Taylor toured the United States with the Bluesbreakers and appeared on such albums as Bare Wires and Blues From Laurel Canyon (both 1968). In 1969, he accepted the Rolling Stones' offer to replace the departing Brian Jones, who died later that year. The Stones had already established their reputation as one of rock's greatest bands and had just issued one of their best LPs, Beggar's Banquet (1968). But Taylor quickly added his imprint on the Stones' style and was present for the legendary concert tours, during their 1969-1974 heyday. He played on some of Let It Bleed (1969) and all of the live disc Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out (1970).</p><p>Sticky Fingers (1971),  was the first studio Stones' album for which he was present during the entire recording. He added his famous vibrato effect to the blues lead guitar line on ""Sway"" and handled most of the guitars on the quietly majestic ""Moonlight Mile."" Perhaps Taylor's best-remembered Stones work was the Santana-like lead guitar in the jam break of the jazzy ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking."" On the Stones' classic 1972 double LP, Exile on Main Street, Taylor co-wrote ""Ventilator Blues"" and contributed bluesy guitar to such chestnuts as ""All Down the Line"" and ""Soul Survivor.""</p><p>Taylor plays wah-wah guitar on the hit single ""(Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo) Heartbreaker,"" from Goats Head Soup (1973), which also exhibited Taylor's melodic touches on ballads such as ""Winter."" Taylor's final LP as a Rolling Stone was It's Only Rock 'n' Roll (1974), which included his long, jazzy solo on ""Time Waits for No One""</p><p>Shortly after the album's release, Taylor quit the Stones. Many theories have been offered for Taylor's departure, including conflict with guitarist Keith Richards and Taylor's fear that he'd get caught up in the band's allegedly drug-crazed lifestyle. Whatever the reason, Taylor's replacement, Ron Wood - formerly of the Faces - brought the band a grittier sound.</p><p>In 1975, Taylor toured Europe in the Jack Bruce Band, led by former Cream bassist Bruce. Four years later, he issued an eponymous jazz-fusion solo debut that sold poorly in the punk-rock era. Taylor toured with the Alvin Lee Band in the early '80s and did a reunion tour with the Bluesbreakers. He played on Bob Dylan's Infidels (1983) and toured with the songwriting legend. During the latter part of the '80s, Taylor formed a series of short-lived bands that played blues-rock in eastern U.S. clubs.</p><p>He issued the live Stranger in This Town and in 1989 was inducted, with the Stones, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In the early '90s, Taylor went to L.A. and worked with the Textones' Carla Olson, the Jimmy Woods Band and others. In the second half of the '90s, he returned to England to play blues festivals with a touring band. In 1998, Taylor issued A Stones Throw and toured in 1999.</p><ul></ul>",,,,,683,Butterfly Boucher,http://www.myspace.com/butterflyboucher,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Butterfly-Boucher/10095822177,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4lUcjMWaX4&feature=player_embedded,http://www.butterflyboucher.com,2245,"<p>...That restless, wandering spirit remained with Butterfly as she grew. Her first real experiments with music were crucial to what would come later. Using a four track recorder at age 10, she would create instrumental tracks by playing every instrument since most of her friends were outside doing the things that most kids her age were supposed to be doing. Her older sister had a band of her own: The Mercy Bell. Butterfly would eventually join her as bass player and backing vocalist and share part of the writing (""Another White Dash"" is a refugee song from that project). A protracted three year demo deal with another US record label only lead to dashed hopes.</p><p>Soon after, a friend named Mike Dixon encouraged her to explore a solo career. It was advice she took to heart. With all the money she had she bought a laptop and moved to Stockton in the North of England to stay with family and friends. While there, she concentrated on simplifying her songs. Previously, she had always tried to cram 5 or 6 ideas into a song, and decided instead to try limiting them to 2 or 3 ideas. Soon after, attention for her solo work started to come. Positive response inspired her to continue writing and recording on her own. She felt she was finally beginning to get the songs out of her notebook and into people's heads. ""I wanted to inspire more people"", she says now. From there, Dixon hooked her up with several contacts, including producer duo Robin Eaton and Brad Jones who eventually took Butterfly into the studio to begin the long road toward making her debut album.</p><p>In the end, scores of instruments found their way onto the master tapes: guitars, drums, bass, piano, vibes, organ, mellotron, toy piano (on ""Soul Back""), Field Organ, banjo, and various percussion (including planks of wood, a tympani, a steel wheel, and a hammer (on ""Busy"").</p><p>Listen to the lonely drops of water that punctuate ""Never Leave Your Heart Alone"".</p><p>It doesn't take long in listening to realize that Butterfly is a welcome arrival.

We're saying what we feel in a simple way with the hope that if you're a human being with a heart that's beating, you will appreciate at least some part of this record"", says Army of Me singer Vince Scheuerman. The big songs of Army of Me's debut CITIZEN speak from the heart, with the feeling that less is more. And it's more reminiscent of early Oasis or The Verve, and R.E.M than quirkily trendy indie pop. Army of Me is transcending their humble Washington DC indie roots.</p><p>""We are trying to be one of the best bands you will ever see"", said lead singer Vince Scheuerman during an interview with Alternative Press magazine (June 2005). Army of Me had just been named one of the top unsigned bands in America by the influential rock magazine, and the article started a barrage of major label interest for the Washington DC based band. This came after several years of DIY touring and a string of self released albums and EPs. The new album CITIZEN represents growth and a new chapter for the band. With the band sounding bigger than ever before, the lyrics deal with desire and personal growth in ""Perfect"", uncertainty and change in ""Going Through Changes"", and rebirth and hope in ""Rise"" - a song inspired by the tsunami of Dec. 26, 2005; just three of the albums 12 tracks. ""It's a very human record"", says Scheuerman.</p><p>Vince (lead vocals/guitar), Brad Tursi (guitar, backing vocals), and Dennis Manuel (drums), formed Army of Me in 2001 and refined their sound with continuous touring of the Northeast, South, and mid-Atlantic of the US. Opening for bigger acts throughout the process, they developed a passionate regional fanbase, leading to sold out shows at DC's famous 9:30 club, and various clubs in New York City.</p><p>Their touring success was only part of the story. ""Come Down to DC"", an epic ode to their roots, was added into full rotation on DC101 in the Fall of 2005 - just the second time in the station's history that they added a song from an unsigned band. Sirius Radio's ""Alt Nation"" added ""Going Through Changes"" to its play list, eventually making the song the 4 most requested and played song on the station - yet another amazing feat for a band who, at the time, were still unsigned. And now, with their album CITIZEN released by the prolific Doghouse Records, which hit stores April 10, 2007, the radio story continues to grow, with adds for ""Going Through Changes"" at KROQ in LA, WOCL in Orlando, DC101 in Washington DC, XM, and SIRIUS.</p><p>Army of Me is an indie band from Washington DC - it's in your best interest to discover them now.</p>",,,,,663,Pato Banton,http://www.myspace.com/patobanton,,,http://patobanton.com,0,"<p>A Pato Banton concert is an event not to be missed and an experience not to be forgotten.</p><p>Positive Vibrations abound with a beat to keep you on your dancing feet, while Pato delivers a message that is food for the mind and soul.

The direction of the concert is totally based on the feedback Pato receives from the audience as there is no fixed set list.

The pair went to concerts together around the DC area and realized they wanted to give the band thing a legitimate shot before school flew by and the real world swallowed them whole. The OK Corral originated as an acoustic duo, and Brett and Mike spent the summer writing 5 originals, and following a plethora of makeshift and legitimate shows, these 5 original songs later became an EP in January 2008. While the duo was eager to play their music to anyone who was willing to listen, they also desired to form a full band. After getting their EP done, various musicians temporarily got involved; practicing, playing shows, but ultimately, not fitting into the bigger picture the two had envisioned.</p><p>In July of 2008, The OK Corral's lineup was finalized with Brett Nickley on lead vocals and guitar, Mike Matthews on lead guitar and vocals, Scott Nickley ..board and vocals, and Michael Burbrink on the drums. The new lineup got off to a fast start selling out Jammin' Java in Vienna, VA in August of 2008. This was both their first show as a full band and their first sell-out performance. Despite all four members going to four different universities across the Commonwealth of Virginia, The OK Corral continues to build up a full head of steam in an effort to make their music heard. Entering the year 2009 with over 15 original songs to their name, The OK Corral has begun to play bigger and bigger shows. Playing to another sold out crowd at Jammin' Java in January really motivated the band to keep what they had going. The band has since shared the stage with various local and regional acts including one of Purevolume.com's top unsigned bands of 2008, Conditions of Richmond, VA, and recent Virgin Records signee, My Favorite Highway.</p><p>The band has gained some national attention as they have been featured as a band of the week in AbsolutePunk.net's self-promotion spotlight drawing comparisons with the likes of Manchester Orchestra, The Format, and Steven Kellogg and the Sixers. The OK Corral is currently looking to bring their music to your ears. With their catchy hooks, mature songwriting, and their outright eagerness to simply have a good time with everyone who is a part of their live music experience, they hope to be playing in a city near you in the near future!</p>",,,,,660,Louis Fabrizi (CD Release Show),http://www.myspace.com/louisfabrizi,,,,2548,"<p>With face melting guitar solos, sweet melodies, driving rhythms, and a lyrical passion for the Lord and his loved ones, Louis Fabrizi's music moves audiences to listen in awe, sing along, and nod in agreement.

The band performs with such virtuosity and energy that they are equally as comfortable performing in a sit down performing arts center as they are in a standing-room-only rock club; and they relish this diversity in their performances.

Each with a slightly different vision and direction for their music, they never gave collaborating with each other a fair shot. As they ventured through more and more failed and directionless music projects, they knew something was missing. They found what was missing when they eventually decided to join forces and create a band together. With Marshall's passion for pop anthems, and Jared's strong compositional skills, Sing Me Insomnia (SMI) began. The band was completed with their friends - Wes Beale and Jordan DePriest.</p><p><br />In August 2008, SMI entered the Mid-Atlantic Battle of the Bands (hosted by Jammin Java), facing bands from all over the region. Despite being the youngest group in the competition (members all younger than 18), SMI swept the opposing bands, winning first place. They didn't stop there. Putting their prize money to good use, they entered into the studio with a batch of infectious pop-rock tunes, and produced a six song EP with upcoming Northern Virginia producer, David Pavluk of The Downtown Fiction (Photo Finish/Atlantic Records). On February 16th, 2010, the first day of their debut, self-titled EP's release, Sing Me Insomnia began to create a huge buzz within the music scene - the album debuting at number 27 on the iTunes' alternative charts - all feats achieved as an unsigned act.</p><p>With a well-received EP, five consecutive sold-out headlining hometown shows at Northern Virginia's most popular venue (Jammin Java), and a large online following, Sing Me Insomnia geared up to release their follow-up EP, entitled ""No Time to Waste"", produced by Paul Barber (Steve Moakler, Action Item, My Favorite Highway) on March 1st, 2011. The EP dropped with a huge first week, debuting in the top 100 of iTunes top albums chart. It also allowed SMI to make their Billboard debut, ranking 9th on Billboard's South Atlantic Heatseeker's Chart. SMI has released their newest single, ""Miss Me Now"" - a huge, anthemic showstopper that's heavy enough to please any rocker, and with a gritty pop edge that will appeal to the masses.

The group found popularity in the Dallas area, sharing stages with Cheap Trick, Ben Harper, and Third Eye Blind, before Cabrera's departure. Making the most of a block of studio time -- a birthday present from his brother -- Ryan cut three original songs that impressed the engineer enough to offer the opportunity to do a full-length -- for free. Elm Street was a self-released success, selling out locally and garnering favorable reviews and a deluge of Internet orders. In 2001, Cabrera signed to Atlantic, which scheduled the long-player Take It All Away for release in 2004.

It was a tour of English folk clubs and he was fourteen years of age. That was a long time ago.

Answer: A good idea; a universal yet somehow unique good idea. The band was over 10 years old and had baffled the mainstream industry before the term ""roots rock"" was coined to explain the likes of West Coasters like Los Lobos and The Blasters. By then, the affiliation with many of the living blues greats seemed to brand The Nighthawks a ""blues band,"" despite the fact that they played with Carl Perkins as well as Muddy Waters. The Nighthawks set off on a musical mystery tour that took them to 49 states and a dozen countries. They played with nearly all the living blues legends as well as a new generation of bands sometimes called ""the Blue Wave,"" and released several important albums, including the best-selling Jacks and Kings with Pinetop Perkins, Luther ""Guitar Junior"" Johnson, Calvin Jones and Bob Margolin.</p><p><em>""The Nighthawks show no sign of slowing down as they enter their fifth decade as a viable force on the contemporary blues scene.

Each step they've taken has widened their appeal. Their releases have topped the Billboard Bluegrass charts. Two singles have garnered Grammy nominations. They've earned ovations from ""newgrass"" music devotees at MerleFest and rock loyalists at Lollapalooza.</p><p>But this band, spearheaded by Australians Carol Young and Kym Warner, is interested less in past accomplishments than in looking ahead for new goals to achieve. That's why their latest release is also in many ways their most significant and impressive to date.</p><p>Produced and engineered by studio veteran Justin Niebank (Vince Gill, Marty Stuart, Keith Urban), The Brick Album is the first to successfully infuse The Greencards' eclectic musical references with the excitement they generate onstage. ""We've been striving for this since our first record,"" says mandolinist Warner. ""We recorded totally in one room this time, with very little isolation. It was all about doing the performance now, without going back to add anything later on.""</p><p>""What you're hearing is all one take,"" bassist and singer Young adds. ""If someone really didn't like what we'd done, we'd play it all again from the top rather than drop the part in. When you drop in a part, you lose a little bit of the feel. You've got to get a run-up to it.""</p><p>That immediacy was heightened by the addition of two new members of the group. Tyler Andal, a young fiddle whiz from Tennessee, reinforces both The Greencards' grounding in roots music and eagerness to let in the fresh air of newgrass, rock, folk elements, Latin America and much more. ""He thinks outside the box,"" Warner explains. ""We've always had a strong rhythmic aspect to our music, and Tyler definitely brings that.""</p><p>The other recent arrival, former National Flatpicking Championship winner Carl Miner, excels as a guitarist in that tradition but more importantly applies his virtuosity equally well beyond it. ""He's good at everything,"" Warner says. ""He's one of the most versatile musicians, and probably the most consistent, we've ever played with. With Tyler and him in the band, everyone is pulling in the same direction.""</p><p>Make that ""directions."" The Brick Album kicks off with ""Make It Out West,"" a rhythmically irresistible chant powered by guest artist Sam Bush's slide mandolin, with lyrics conjuring restless dreams and far horizons. From there the songs take listeners through ever-changing vistas - the Spanish-inflected ""Heart Fixer,"" whose vocals by Young and guest artist Vince Gill stir memories of Marty Robbins; the slinky, teasing ""Mrs. Madness,"" written by Warner after a night of watching Bored to Death; the magical ""Girl in the Telescope,"" which floats like a feather in sunlight; ""Tale of KangaRio,"" an intimate Brazilian dance of mandolin and guitar; ""Loving You Is the Only Way To Fly,"" a dreamy evocation of the Louvin and Everly Brothers, the pillars of classic country duet vocals.</p><p>There's much more, but two tracks bear special mention. The wistful ""Faded"" is a sweetly harmonized tune, so natural that you don't even notice its unusual 5/4 time signature. Similarly, ""Adelaide"" is a brisk instrumental, built over a rushing stream of chord changes made accessible by melodies and solos of eloquent coherence.</p><p>""As we get older, the more I think about it, the more we want something in music you can cling to,"" Warner says. ""That comes with melody. What we do on The Brick Album allows us to have something not only on the record but also on our live show. It brings it back to ""more than anything, this is about lyrics and harmony.""</p><p>It's also about integrating fans more than ever into the band's process. The Greencards followed an independent path with The Brick Album, partnering with its followers rather than with record labels to fund its sessions. In exchange for contributing to the ""Buy a Brick"" project, each donor had his or her name inscribed on a brick within the wall that comprises its cover art.</p><p>""The times have changed a lot in the music industry, not so much in the creative side but in business side of making music,"" Warner says. ""We just wanted to give something unique and special to people, not just by sending them an early copy of the record by putting their names on the artwork. That makes them fully a part of it.""</p><p>But it's the music that makes us all part of this journey. Warner and Young were both steeped in country music; she charted several No. 1 singles in her homeland as a solo artist and he won the Australian National Bluegrass Mandolin Championship for four consecutive years. They moved to Austin, put together the first incarnation of the Greencards there and today call Nashville their home.</p><p>With The Brick Album, though, the world becomes more than ever their stage. Their sound defies category, balancing taste and technique, sing-along melodies and challenging arrangements. There may be a wall on its cover, but the future suggested on these tracks knows no barrier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-greencards/id41987225?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://twitter.com/#!/thegreencards,,591,Janet Emma and Seven West (CD Release),http://www.myspace.com/jemandsevenwest,,,http://www.janetemma.com,0,"<p>Janet Emma Garbe, along with songwriting partner and friend Julia Kasdorf, leads the alt-country band One Horse Town since it's inception in 2001.

Born the youngest child of two blind parents, William was raised in the outskirts of the steel city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Due to the family's inability to communicate through normal visual means, William's childhood home was filled with a myriad of sounds to replace what eyes could not see. The house was suffused with pianos, guitars, trombones, talking birds, classical records, family sing-a-longs, bedtime stories, and the bellowing of a pipe organ, which his father built into the house with his own hands. When his father's orchestral records were not resonating through the walls, his mother would educate him on the folk stylings of James Taylor, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, and Simon &amp; Garfunkel. By the completion of his youth and schooling, Fitzsimmons had become well-versed at a variety of instruments, at the minor expense of social standing, interactional skills, and a knowledge of proper shaving technique.</p><p>Fitzsimmons' path into music was likewise unusual, forsaking the hobby for many years to work with the mentally ill and pursue an education in the field of mental health. It was during his last semester of graduate school that William pooled monies from past birthday's, holidays, and snow shoveling outings, and bought cheap home recording equipment to begin creating songs again (the first collection of which eventually became his debut album). After finally achieving his goal of becoming a practicing therapist, William left, and returned again to his love of crafting and playing songs. He felt that is where he most belonged. Somewhere between a singing therapist, and a counselor who writes songs, is where Fitzsimmons endeavors to be. Using songs to address matters that he believes need to be addressed.</p><p>William draws from those early folks stylings of his mother's music, and the embellished instrumentation of his father's. He is often compared to contemporaries Sufjan Stevens, Iron &amp; Wine, and the late Elliott Smith, not only for his unique style and skill in writing and proclivity to deal with substantive and evocative subject matter, but also for his use of organic and colorful melodies and arrangements. His first two records were completely self-produced and his new album, ""The Sparrow And The Crow,"" produced by Marshall Altman at Galt Line Studios in Los Angeles, is his first studio recorded work. While his lyricism deals often with darker undertones (his most recent album is said to have been written following his own divorce), a measure of hopefulness is always carefully blended in. Even with his short tenure as a songwriter, William has already received mention in noted publications such as Billboard, Paste Magazine, and Performing Songwriter Magazine, and his music has been featured on several television programs such as ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Army Wives.""</p><p>Gold In The Shadow represents a welcomed musical departure, not from authenticity in writing, but in the field of focus. It is a return to his pre-music therapeutic passions, but with one eye now fixated on actual and optimistic change. It is ripe with personal elements, but also represents his first foray into external perspective taking; examining the lives and psychological struggles of those around him in addition to his own. It is an acknowledgment of the shadow self and the Todestrieb (Freud's ""death instinct""); but, even still and more so, an acceptance of hope.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>", http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fwilliam-fitzsimmons%252Fid213326316%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/wfitzsimmons,"<iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/5hlHhSnJWZs"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",556,Love Dungeon,,,,,0,,,,,,554,The Potentials,,,,,0,,,,,,553,Noah Woods,,,,,0,,,,,,551,Margot MacDonald (CD Release),,,,,0,,,,,,548,Night of the Living Shred with Joe Stump,http://www.myspace.com/joestump,,http://www.shredacademy.com/artists/j_stump.htm,,0,"<p>Joe Stump is the most over the top rock guitarist known to man.

Holed up in a rural cabin with minimal recording gear and a houseful of instruments, Delmhorst recorded her new songs alone and off the clock, in late night sessions that yielded layers of intimate vocals combined with nylon string and electric guitars, cellos, keyboards, and percussion. She treated the work like oil painting, allowing the canvas to breathe and change over the course of many months until the picture emerged. With the core of each song patiently assembled, she brought in a diverse cast of players to add sparse backing lines of drums, keys, guitar, and vinyl-based samples, and then signed on co-producer Sam Kassirer (Josh Ritter) in arrangement and mixing, enlisting him meanwhile to play keyboards and percussion on several songs. The result is collection of songs fully realized and even lush at times, but retaining a hushed intensity, a spirit of lo-fi intimacy and unhurried exploration.</p><p>Kris Delmhorst has built a thriving career and a devoted following from the ground up, and without major label hype. With Shotgun Singer, Delmhorst has trained that voice on a series of gracefully open lyrics and figures that transcend genre, ranging into the borderlands between indie-rock and folk, that nameless territory inhabited by such hard-to-classify artists as Juana Molina, Feist, Iron &amp; Wine, and Laura Veirs. Adventurous, elegant, lucid, and haunting, the record is the work of a musician at full stride who has found a musical language equal to her vision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fkris-delmhorst%252Fid5056706%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,,,537,Where's My Face (Dubstep + Electrohouse) w/ Viking,http://myspace.com/pjtheviking,,,,7591,,,,,,538,THE GRENADE,,,,,0,,,,,,535,Local Matinee with Us and Them,http://www.myspace.com/usandthemmyspace,,,,1880,,,,,,534,Rifle Ridge,http://www.myspace.com/rifleridge,,,,2005,,,,,,530,EVX,,,,,0,,,,,,529,Local Matinee with Union Street,,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Union-Street/22227829059?sid=c870fc2c62482fa3c5126e3072978085&ref=s,,,1726,,,,,,527,test,,,,,0,,,,,,520,4 Out Of 5 Doctors,,,,http://www.4outof5drs.com,0,"<p>""You never would have known, based on the briskly paced, sold-out show Sunday night at Jammin' Java, that the last time 4 Out of 5 Doctors played together was at the Bayou in 1991. The four-piece pop band with three strong songwriters was one of the most successful Washington area outfits of the early 1980s, touring with Hall and Oates and opening shows for the Cars, the Clash and others, as well as accumulating a considerable local following.</p><p>Never quite as radical as new wave, the Doctors' brand of innocently cheeky power pop became marginalized. The band members eventually moved on -- most notably bassist Cal Everett, who went west and made a career playing in cover bands for high-paying corporate events.</p><p>So there he was Sunday night, at center stage 17 years later, dapper as ever in a white linen suit and skinny necktie, playing sophisticated pop bass lines while singing clever, self-knowing songs such as ""Modern Man,"" ""Waiting for a Change,"" ""New Wave Girls"" and ""I Want Her"" to a room full of fans who knew the lyrics.</p><p>Guitarist Jeff Severson added catchy keyboard riffs to the melodies while guitarist George Pittaway re-created feisty, fiery solos to drummer Tom Ballew's inventive rock beats. At no point did it appear the musicians were rusty, and in fact, Everett made it look downright easy.</p><p>The brightly polished songs have aged well, and it's not hard to imagine the Doctors could once again be regulars on the local music scene, even as a nostalgia act..."" <em>-Buzz McClain, The Washington Post (July 22, 2008)<br /></em></p>",,,,,516,Pierce Pettis,,,,http://www.piercepettis.com,7580,"<p>Pierce Pettis, adored by both critics and public alike, is one of this generation's most masterful songwriters.

It may not be a huge departure from some of his past albums musically, but lyrically Jurado has taken a giant leap forward and there is no turning back. Best known for his dark yet fragile first person fictional tales, Jurado now unlocks the door and invites us into his own enigmatic world with an energy and intensity that is all-consuming.</p><p>Jurado took a full year to make this record, longer than ever before, as he ran away from and eventually found himself in his own songs. He subsequently found refuge in sharing the songs with his closest friends and bandmates, Eric Fisher and Jenna Conrad. Having walked alongside him through this most challenging journey, the songs that came out of it are as much theirs as his. Jurado, Fisher, and Conrad collaborated on the compositions - some much more rocking than Jurado fans are used to, but ever as intense - and pulled in producers Kory Kruckenberg and Casey Foubert to contribute their own unique stylings.</p><p>Recording started in the summer months and the sweltering heat, and wrapped in the freezing temps of winter. (It is clear on first listen that two distinct seasons are represented through ""Caught In the Trees"" - an accidental metaphor perhaps?) There was laughter and there was introspection, and the result is a record that Jurado loyalists will find was worth the wait. And perhaps a reason to listen for those who have yet to give this bedraggled storyteller a chance.</p>",,,,,505,Zelos,http://www.myspace.com/excitethemind,http://www.facebook.com/pages/ZELOS/6786496068,http://www.youtube.com/thebandzelos,,0,"<p>ZELOS (pr. zay-loss): Excitement of mind, ardour, fervour of spirit; ardour in embracing, pursuing, defending anything; zeal in behalf of, for a person or thing.</p><p>ZELOS is a rock band out of the suburbs of Washington, D.C. The band's unique, melodic-rock sound draws from a lineup of highly trained, gifted musicians and is quickly gaining recognition with each new audience. ZELOS has received a unanimously enthusiastic response with local crowds after finishing as the top rock act in the regional finals of the 2007 Emergenza Festival. Circulation of their single Steal Away on DC 101 radio in promotion of local shows has fueled excitement for their engaging live show.</p><p>The Groveman brothers form the core of this quartet and received their classical training from the Levine School of Music in Georgetown and the University of Maryland. After years performing as a string ensemble for Washington area social functions, the brother's affinity for songwriting and live performance was energized by the addition of an experienced drummer.</p><p>The venues they play these days are significantly louder than the gazebo garden parties of their early years, but the sensitivity of their musical instincts remains intact in the rock context. ZELOS has been described as a mixture between Coldplay, John Mayer, and The Fray, but lead singer Judah Groveman describes the following criteria for the music they make:</p><p>""Whenever people ask me what kind of music we enjoy, I've always had the hardest time answering that question. Instead of trying to spontaneously come up with an exhaustive list of our influences--to include Bach, Beethoven, and the Beatles--I just say, &lsquo;We're into any music that strikes a chord of emotion common to humanity with individual originality.' We hope some of our music achieves this for our listeners.""</p><p>On the heels of their self-produced studio debut ""Before the Morning"" EP (2007), the band is excited about each opportunity they have to bring their ever-growing catalogue of songs to new ears.</p>",,,,,503,Bliss FM,http://www.myspace.com/blissfm,http://www.facebook.com/blissfm,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm9Y-b76mQ,,7848,"<p>Bliss FM was created in the summer of 2007 when John Carmichael and Sebastien Christie met in high school. John, the emcee, grew up on hip-hop obsessing over the culture since elementary school. He pulls inspiration from growing up in Northern Virginia and also spending summers in Serbia, an Eastern-European country, where the rest of his family lives. He began rapping in high school, freestyling with his friends just for fun and soon after that he became very serious about his craft. Sebastien (producer/vocalist) has held a guitar in his hands since a very young age. His father Spanish and his mother French, he is tri-lingual and this plays a big part in who he is. After years of jazz training and having played in numerous bands, Bliss FM was created. .... They called themselves Bliss-FM which stands for Bliss for the Masses. The duo released a self-titled project at the end of 2007 to very warm reactions from fellow students. They would become more serious about their craft and spend the next year strictly making music and doing small shows in the area. In early 2009, there second effort, The Food, was released locally and on the internet receiving over 1000 downloads and earning them a local buzz. After press from the album, they would bring over 100 people out to a packed 930 club for a battle of the bands and as accounts go from that night, ""The crowd left after they were done."" Capitalizing off the success of that show the band booked a gig at Jammin' Java, one of the premier venues in the Washington, D.C. area. They would sell out this show and a stunning performance earned them coverage from local newspapers including The Vienna Connection. .. .. Poised to do big things after signing with a personal manager, the release of their new CD entitled ""Painters of the Portrait"" is a 5 song disk that is sure to make a a statement.

But I do need to get this off my chest. The new music that is set to come out this July 2010, under the name Lydia, is going to be the last recordings ever put out by the band. We are very grateful to have been able to put out as much music as we have and to reach so many people. I assure you this is not something I've decided over a few months, but more so in the past year. This has been something I've been thinking about for quite some time now and it's just the right place and time for me to move on to other things and projects. I know Steve and myself have really enjoyed performing for all the people that have come out to a show over the last several years. And I can't even begin to explain all the amazing people I've met while being a gypsy traveling around the country, unbelievable.</p><p>This decision has nothing at ALL to do with a lack of output from the band. I can honestly say the new Lydia material coming out in July is the best music I've ever had the opportunity and privilege to release. This release IS the best music the band has or will ever put out.</p><p>One last thing. Lydia has amazing fans. I can't even begin to count how many times I've seen Lydia artwork and lyrics tattooed all over you guys. So I thought it would only be right to do one last goodbye/farewell tour along with the new music coming out. For how much you ladies and gent's have and will support us it's really the only thing to do. It will be a FULL US tour, and if it doesn't come to your city it will surely come to a city near by. The dates will start this summer on JULY 20th and go into late August. The exact dates will be up in the coming weeks.</p><p>So we will see you ONE last time with new music in both our hands. The very last Lydia music being released will come to you in early JULY, and the very last tour will be at your door step in JULY/AUG.</p><p>I can't even explain how much fun I've had while performing in all of your cities. And calling YOUR city home for the night. I am grateful to have met every one of you wonderful people.

That's not to say he hasn't been busy in the years in between.</p><p>After releasing The Break-In on Columbia Records in 2007, Ari decided it was time to take more creative control over his music and parted ways with his label.  Utilizing all the technology available to him, in 2008 he launched his highly successful 52 project, a web based subscription service that found him writing, recording, and releasing a new song every Monday for an entire year.  For those keeping track, that's 52 new songs in 52 weeks!  Performing Songwriter called these songs ""high-caliber and heartfelt."" At the end of the year, the subscribers were asked to vote for their 12 favorite songs from the project and the ones that got the most votes were then reworked and digitally released in the form of the album Twelve Mondays in early 2009. The Washington Post wrote ""An urbane folk-rocker with a sonorous baritone, Ari Hest sounds like a man out of time"" and said Twelve Mondays was ""skillful, pretty and straightforward.""</p><p>52 helped Ari explore different genres and experiment with new instrumentation.  And even with 40 unreleased songs under his belt after the release of Twelve Mondays, Ari kept on writing and experimenting.  The end result, Sunset Over Hope Street, is a slight departure from his previous work. Ari expressed his self-challenging nature by taking his guitar parts and seeing if another lead instrument, like a piano, could take the guitar's place.  The album is also awash with a variety of string arrangements and unique percussion parts.</p><p>Unlike previous albums, Sunset Over Hope Street was created over a protracted period of time - more than a year. Because of this, Ari was really able to take time, listen back and edit - a luxury that on previous albums had not been afforded him. There were vocals, drums, guitar parts, and even full songs that wound up being scrapped and others added as the album evolved.   His patience paid off and the result, despite this different approach, is unmistakably Ari Hest.</p><p>There are a lot of themes covered on this record; from existential songs like ""Until Next Time"" and ""A Good Look Around"", to the more politically driven ""Business of America"" and ""Swan Song"".  One theme that pops up repeatedly throughout the album is the passage of time - trying to take advantage of opportunities as they arise (""If I Knew You'd Say Yes""), lamenting the missed opportunities (""Sunset Over Hope Street""), wondering if anything better will come along in the future (""How Would I Know"") - these are thoughts that linger in life, sometimes motivating and occasionally stunting one's evolution.</p><p>Ari has built his career the old fashioned way, doing 150 dates a year for the better part of the last decade. In the past 24 months, he has added Europe into the mix through multiple tours in Ireland, Czech Republic, Germany and Belgium.  Film and television has also expanded Ari's fan base.  His music has been licensed numerous times to shows such as Private Practice and One Tree Hill, and he scored the film Dreamriders, which won numerous independent film awards, and also featured several of Ari's songs.</p><p>Ari's 2010 side project entitled The Open Sea, a duo with fellow singer/songwriter Rosi Golan, was also very well received both by fans and in the licensing world.  Their work garnered three major television placements in the first six weeks after the release of their EP called Little Apple.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,496,All Things Rock Summer Camp 2009 Recital,,,,http://www.allthingsrockonline.com,0,,,,,,494,Slow Runner,http://www.myspace.com/slowrunner,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Slow-Runner/12803516186,http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=slow+runner&search_type=&aq=f,http://www.slowrunnermusic.com,0,"<p>how to write your band's bio:</p><p>step 1 - start with information about your early years that nobody really cares about but that you have to put in there because otherwise the bio is thin and it's completely obvious how unsuccessful you really are.</p><p>ex. slow runner started in 2003 when singer/songwriter michael flynn and multi-instrumentalist josh kaler began musically fornicating together after college.</p><p>step 2 - create a mythos around how your 'sound' was formed.</p><p>ex. one night while walking through the woods michael and josh pulled a sword from a stone and the curtains of heaven opened up and they simultaneously realized their musical destiny involved casio, loud drums, and short pop songs about girls.</p><p>step 3 - puff your chest out and list accomplishments no matter how insignificant they might be.</p><p>ex. michael flynn almost won the john lennon songwriting scholarship in 2001. then he did win the flat rock music festival songwriting contest, then he and kaler made 'no disassemble', formed a full band, and signed a deal with j records in 2005.</p><p>step 4 - totally ignore inexplicable gaps in the narrative of the bio.</p><p>ex. what happened to our deal with j records? shut up. what happened to your mom, that's the real question assholes. move along, there's nothing to see here!</p><p>step 5 - start name-dropping like you're trying to get into the v.i.p. room at tonic on a friday night. this step is extremely important.</p><p>ex. slow runner has toured with folks like josh ritter, the damnwells, say anything, built to spill, gomez, sam roberts band, and evan dando, as well as had their music featured on shows like greys anatomy and one tree hill.</p><p>step 6 - mention the new guys.</p><p>ex. michael and josh are now lucky enough to be playing with jonathan gray (formerly of jump little children) on bass and scott baumil (formerly of the young republicans) on guitar.</p><p>[notice the extra name-dropping i snuck in there with parenthesis? bonus points!]</p><p>step 7 - mention the new product you're trying to shove down people's ears. make it sound badass.</p><p>ex. with their newest records, 'shiv!' and 'mermaids', slow runner takes their sound to a new level with flynn's deepest songwriting yet and enough musical tricks and turns to make brian wilson blush. it's loud and ornery, but sophisticated and elegant too. like a brilliant 14-year-old debutante with a drinking problem.</p><p>do all that, mix it up, sprinkle some basil on top, BAM! you've got a bio. see how easy that is?</p>",,,,,492,Deuce Ur Hynest & G Hector,http://www.myspace.com/deuceurhynest,,,,0,,,,,,491,Black Irish (K-Beta and Sketch),http://www.myspace.com/alienbrain,,,http://www.myspace.com/sketchva,0,,,,,,489,Matt Wertz (at The Hamilton),,http://www.facebook.com/mattwertz ,http://www.mattwertz.com/videos.aspx,http://www.mattwertz.com,16867,"<p><span class=""text_exposed_show"">My love for visual art led me eight  hours from home to the University of Illinois, where I studied  Industrial Design. As a result of that experience, music became my  respite&mdash;my escape from the responsibility of class work. Dorm life  served to provide a small, built&ndash;in audience who graciously embraced my  first attempts at songwriting.  Before I knew it, I was recording  versions of those songs on my roommate&rsquo;s computer and burning copies for  my new cohabiting fans. Eventually I started playing concerts outside  the walls of Scott Hall and made the leap to register my name as a  dot-com. That may not seem like a big deal today, but at the time, those  were the early, shaky steps I took toward a full-fledged career in the  music industry. <br /> <br /> Early on, I was shown many graces&mdash;like a loan  from my parents to pay for the first 1,000 copies of my debut record,  Somedays (2001). To assuage their fear that I was throwing my life away,  I democratically assured them that I&rsquo;d get a job after the summer was  over. Needless to say, that never happened. On the heels of the Twenty Three  Places release, people started taking notice. Creative Artists Agency  got involved booking my shows. Nettwerk took over my management. And a  bunch of record labels started knocking down my door. But none of them  felt like a good fit. So what did I do? I did what I&rsquo;d always done: I  recorded another record on my own and kept touring.   Everything in Between was the first record I  released with any kind of organized push behind it. We came out of the  gates strong, charting high on the iTunes pop charts and filming a video  for the song &ldquo;Carolina.&rdquo; Some of the songs landed in unexpected  places&mdash;on TV&rsquo;s &ldquo;Brothers and Sisters&rdquo; and in theaters via movies like My  Super Ex-Girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Since the start of my career, I&rsquo;ve sold  around 75,000 albums, played shows with Ben Folds, Jamie Cullum, and One  Republic, as well as headlined sold-out clubs around the country.  This  was all done, mind you, as an independent artist. Over time, momentum  built and more labels took notice, including Universal Republic. Finally  I encountered a label that felt right, a label that could pull the  trigger, a label that understood where I was coming from. And so, I  signed.&nbsp; In  eight years of touring through hundreds of venues, playing three albums&rsquo;  worth of songs for thousands of listeners, that connection is what  fuels my passion. Ultimately, the thing that you and I have here&mdash;between  the words and the chords and the lights and the beats&mdash;that is the thing  that encourages me to keep singing. </span></p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fmatt-wertz%252Fid73644692%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/mattwertz,,488,TurkeyPalooza 2010 with Along Those Lines,http://www.myspace.com/alongthoselinesmusic,,,http://www.alongthoselinesmusic.com,0,"<p>Having braved 2 years together, this Washington, DC based powerhouse has deviated the normal course to bring forth a new brand of music.

What if Grunge and Punk got together, frisky in the spring, and parented an illegitimate child who looked suspiciously like good old fashioned Rock and Roll? Notwithstanding the fact that Punk and Grunge would probably get in a huge throwdown, and end up dragging Rock and Roll into an uncomfortable Jerry Springer episode, the end result would be the original Grunk Rock (hence the name, Grunk Rock Hooligans). Take that, and add the influence of metal and reggae, then you have the current Grunk Rock sound.</p><p>That sound allows Permanent Ascent to vary their musical set at any given show through any of the component styles. It's not uncommon to hear some metal-esque songs coupled with some strongly punk driven songs, coupled with some reggae born songs, all in one set! All brought to you in an energy level and a stage performance which will make you question your sanity, though only briefly before you succumb to the overwhelming-ness of it all (if that's even a word). The songs Permanent Ascent presents in their live show are a testament to their diversity in music. If you've only heard one, listen to another. You'll be in for a treat. I promise.</p>",,,,,483,The Kennedys (at The Hamilton),,http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Kennedys/27437662127,http://www.youtube.com/artist/The_Kennedys,http://www.kennedysmusic.com,17759,"<p>The story of Pete and Maura Kennedy's personal and professional relationship, now in its second decade, is somewhere between fate and a fairytale. How else can you explain a chance meeting in Austin between two East Coast-born musicians that immediately sparked a songwriting collaboration, a first date at Buddy Holly's grave, an enduring romance, and a creative partnership that radiates warmth, positive energy, and captivating music?</p><p>In 1992, Virginia native Pete Kennedy was playing a solo show at Austin's Continental Club on a brief sabbatical from his duties as country-folk singer-songwriter Nanci Griffith's lead guitarist when he met former Syracuse, NY, resident Maura Boudreau, enjoying a night off from performing with her own country-rock band, The Delta Rays. The duo ""instantly connected on a soul level, or maybe even something deeper,"" according to Pete. They wrote their first song together the following day before Pete returned to the road, and rendezvoused ten days later at mutual hero Buddy Holly's grave in Lubbock, Tex., 500 miles equidistant between them. And that's how it started . . .</p><p>After Pete and Maura's fateful 1992 meeting (the subject of their first Appleseed CD's title song, ""Half a Million Miles"") and several years of touring and recording with Nanci Griffith, the duo seceded amicably from Griffith's Blue Moon Orchestra and became The Kennedys, recording CDs that encompass their favorite musical styles while incorporating  naturalistic, transcendental and mythological concepts into their songs and lives.</p><p>With the release of their tenth CD as The Kennedys and recent CDs by their Strangelings and Stringbusters side projects, as well as two new solo recordings (Pete Kennedy's ""Guitarslinger"", and Maura's debut solo CD, ""Parade of Echoes"" added to their discography, Pete and Maura remain the Energizer bunnies of the folk/rock world. Their touring schedule makes Bob Dylan seem lazy - they've played about 1500 gigs in the last 12 years, everywhere from house concerts to major festivals, and have recently rejoined Nanci Griffith's tour as part of her band and as her opening act in theatres and festivals around the world.</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-kennedys/id2563494?uo=4&partnerId=30,,,,481,FlatSpin,http://www.myspace.com/flatspinrock,,,,2147,"<p>Flat Spin: (aeronautics) a complex maneuver that should only ever be attempted by the most advanced pilot.</p><p>FlatSpin: (the band) a complex blend of vocals, guitars, bass and drums resulting in advanced rock-n-roll!</p><p>With a common background in aviation, the three founding members Dave (bass), Chris (drums) and Thorsten (guitar) only really took-off with the on-time arrival of Anne (vocals) and Joe (guitar)!</p><p>FlatSpin hail from the D.C.

Thirty-plus years later, he's still writing acclaimed songs and has released 14 studio albums, including a Grammy-nominated tribute to another Mississippi legend, Jimmie Rodgers. He performs around the world and even finds time to pursue his latest artistic adventure, this time in photography: an exhibit of his cell phone photographs recently opened at a Nashville art gallery.</p><p>From those humble beginnings Steve eventually moved to New York City to focus on his music, and found that his artful mixture of introspective pop, rock, folk, country and soul could not be ignored by the music industry. In 1978, just months after arriving in the big city, Forbert signed his first record deal with CBS Records. His debut album, Alive On Arrival, showcased his distinctive musicality and became one of the year's most acclaimed albums. After being compared to folk-based stars like Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan, Forbert still managed to forge his own, more modern path with his hit sophomore record Jackrabbit Slim. The highlight of the album was the #11 Billboard hit ""Romeo's Tune:"" an upbeat song with timeless lyrics sweetened by a poetic sensibility, which has since become Steve's signature style. His brash-yet-sensitive take on songwriting and his unaffected delivery propelled the album up the charts, leading to sold-out shows and a feature in Rolling Stone magazine and even a high profile cameo a Cyndi Lauper's tux-wearing, flower-toting boyfriend at the end of the ""Girl's Just Wanna Have Fun"" video from 1983.</p><p>Steve was inducted into the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame in 2006, and ""Romeo's Tune"" was covered by Keith Urban in 2007. Forbert is one of the few artists who can mesmerize a crowd with nothing but a distinctive voice, an acoustic guitar and his trusty harmonica slung around his neck, letting the purity of his music stand on its own.  As one reviewer recently remarked, ""Forbert is a hardcore troubadour who, artistically speaking, continues to fight the good fight by releasing one excellent album after another and working his ass off show after show to earn every single fan's loyalty.""</p><p>Meet me in the middle of the night<br />Let me hear you say everything's alright<br />Let me smell the moon in your perfume<br />- ""Romeo's Tune""</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fsteve-forbert%252Fid194529%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,https://twitter.com/#!/SteveForbert,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""233"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/pEZvLXLwOWU"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""233"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/yE79UxDu7Xc"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"476,DSI Records Alumni presents: A Punk Rock Family Reunion,http://www.myspace.com/dsirecords ,,,,1805,,,,,,475,Black Bird Lewis,,,,,0,,,,,,474,Pat Sommer's Project,,,,,0,,,,,,473,Local Matinee with New Experience Band,http://www.myspace.com/newexperianceband,,,,1917,,,,,,471,Mary Fahl (October Project),http://www.myspace.com/hobokenbased,http://www.facebook.com/maryfahlmusic,http://maryfahl.com/videos,http://maryfahl.com,15249,"<!--[endif] --><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">A Voice to &ldquo;Fahl&rdquo; in Love With</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">When you&rsquo;re dubbed as the &ldquo;lovechild&ldquo; of Stevie Nicks and Peter Steel (by <a href=""http://allthingsmusic.com/"">allthingsmusic.com</a>), you know you have something special.&nbsp; Mary Fahl is just that.&nbsp; Flying solo from cult folk band, October Project, Fahl hits a chord with her ethereal voice and haunting lyrics.&nbsp; Her music has been featured in films &ldquo;God and Generals&rdquo; and&nbsp; &ldquo;The Guys.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her voice is one that will certainly stay with you long after you&rsquo;ve left the room.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;""></span><em><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""><a href=""http://youtu.be/0FFQ0rCm1Mc""></a></span></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fmary-fahl%252Fid1422580%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/#!/maryfahlmusic,,470,Victory Red,,,,,0,,,,,,468,Judd and Maggie,http://www.myspace.com/juddandmaggie  ,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Judd-and-Maggie/8508696162?ref=ts,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EUzIvHMArU,http://www.juddandmaggiemusic.com,1257,,,,,,467,Chris Merritt (full band),http://www.myspace.com/chrismerritt,http://www.facebook.com/people/Chris-Merritt/720498898,http://www.youtube.com/user/MachinePiano,http://www.chrismerrittmusic.com,0,"<p>Genuine.

Two years later, the youngest one was playing the definitive 8-year-old's version of ""Desolation Row"" on his ukulele. He soon abandoned that instrument to teach himself the flute, violin and guitar.</p><p>Within ten years, and barely out of high school, Garnet Rogers was on the road as a full- time working musician with his older brother Stan. Together they formed what has come to be accepted as one of the most influential acts in North American folk music.</p><p>Since then, Garnet Rogers has established himself as 'One of the major talents of our time"".

With his ""smooth, dark baritone"" (Washington Post) his incredible range, and thoughtful, dramatic phrasing, Garnet is widely considered by fans and critics alike to be one of the finest singers anywhere. His music, like the man himself, is literate, passionate, highly sensitive, and deeply purposeful.

Not long ago, he fell victim to one such turn.  As Hoge rode his scooter home from the studio, he was struck by an oncoming van that had veered into his lane. There were no skid marks. Launched off his bike, Hoge ended up bloodied, broken-boned, temporarily blinded, and near death.</p><p>For ten months, the accident sidelined Hoge. For ten months, it made him do something he hadn't done in 18 years: stop the music.  Eight months after the incident he re-entered the studio in pursuit of that mission. He now has his health, an invigorated spirit, and a renewed sense of his musical journey.</p><p>Even though half of The Wreckage was written and most of it recorded after the crash, images of the episode are only discreetly woven into the fabric of the album, like streaks of red on a dark surface. That's because Hoge would rather leave those lines, words, and phrases to interpretation.</p><p>Released one year almost to the day of his accident, The Wreckage is not, song by song, a celebration of life. The sentiments are too dark, his lyrics too biting, his voice brimming with moodiness. Risen from the ashes of Hoge's own ""wreckage,"" the recording is an incredible achievement, hands-down his best work to date.

After releasing two albums on Lava Records - ""Greetings from Imrie House"" (2005) and ""Modern Minds and Pastimes"" (2007) - with combined worldwide sales of over 2 million, three gold records and eight different #1 singles in seven countries (including a #1 song in the US), The Click Five are set to release their third studio album worlwide. Their new single ""Don't Let Me Go"" is starting a wildfire on the web. The video was made in partnership with MTV EXIT, an organization working to stop human trafficking and exploitation.</p><p>Before starting work on their new album, the band completed a tour of Southeast Asia in 2008 as part of MTV EXIT's concert series. This tour saw them making history in Cambodia, performing the first rock concert ever held at Angkor Wat Temple (co-headlining with Placebo) and headlining Olympic Stadium in Phnom Penh to an audience of over 30,000. In December, 2008, they finished out a tremendous year with their first solo show in Beijing to a sell-out crowd.</p><p>Returning home to Boston, where they all met while attending the Berklee College of Music, feeling inspired, and with a renewed energy after their successful tour, the band went straight back in to the studio with producer Mike Denneen (Fountains of Wayne, Aimee Mann) to begin recording their third album. The new album, ""TCV"", showcases the band's undeniable talent for writing timeless pop songs with an edge.

Instead, he channels joy, love, humor, sadness... every aspect of the human experience, through his guitar.</p><p>Only the finest musicians have the ability to capture the nuances of life in sound, which puts Johnny in a very exclusive group of six-stringers that includes Les Paul, Wes Montgomery, Jeff Beck, Chet Atkins, and Jimi Hendrix. The secret is his blend of melody, sonic definition, technique and that indefinable-yet-tangible quality called ""soul."" And he's eloquently shared that secret on the CDs Sometime Tuesday Morning (2001), Get Inside (2004), and the instructional DVD Taste, Tone, Space (2006), which are approaching combined sales of 150,000 copies. All the virtues of Johnny A.'s playing are in abundant display on One November Night, a brand new DVD/CD set recorded live at Scullers in his hometown of Boston, MA.</p><p>""We were coming off a long tour,"" Johnny relates. ""Plus, my daughter had just been in her first car wreck, so I wasn't sure if we should even record this show, and yet, the music and the audience and the night were beautiful. Everyone and everything in the room came together to make it an extremely special experience.""</p><p>That's obvious from the opening chord cascade of the high-spirited ""I Had To Laugh"" to the rich, warm vibrato-shaded ""Lullabye For Nicole"" to the country &amp; western soundscape ""Tex Critter"" to the rave-up ""Jimi Jam,"" a tribute to Hendrix, Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton and other '60s blues and rock icons who have been among Johnny's many influences during his years as a performer.</p><p>Most of the night's repertoire is drawn from Johnny's previous studio albums, but this is the first time the ferocious ""Jimi Jam"" and his artful interpretations of The Beatles ""The Night Before"" and Chuck Berry's ""Memphis"" have been recorded on CD. The DVD concludes with a mesmerizing solo rendition of The Left Banke's ""Walk Away Renee"" that was filmed outdoors against the backdrop of a vibrant New England sunset.</p><p>""For me, One November Night is a special way to end the chapter of my career that Sometime Tuesday Morning and Get Inside represents,"" says Johnny.<br />""It's not that I won't play those songs anymore,"" he adds. After all, they won him a place in the hearts of a still-growing legion of fans and at the top of the Triple A radio charts, where ""Oh Yeah"" became the first number one instrumental in more than a decade.</p><p>That extensive airplay and a live performance on syndicated radio's popular ""Bob and Tom"" show also propelled Sometime Tuesday Morning and Get Inside to the apex of Amazon.com's best-sellers list, where both titles jockeyed for the number-one and number-two positions.</p><p>""Those albums helped me establish my identity as an instrumental artist after decades leading rock and pop bands, and as a sideman for Peter Wolf, Bobby Whitlock, and others,"" Johnny explains.</p><p>They also earned Johnny invitations to share the stage with, and ultimately win the admiration of, B.B. King, Les Paul, George Thorogood, Jeff Beck and J.J. Cale, among others. He's also performed at such prestigious festivals as Eric Clapton's Crossroads, the Montreal Jazz Festival, and Tokyo's Fuji Rock Festival.</p><p>Although an instrumentalist, Johnny thinks like a singer as he plays, composes and improvises on guitar. ""I'm always interested in dynamics and tone far more than the amount of notes played,"" Johnny explains. ""What's most important is that every song has a strong, clear melody; not how fast or flashy the solo is going to be. That's a lesson I learned when I fell in love with The Beatles and other bands of the British Invasion, which is still my favorite era in music.""</p><p>As Johnny explores various genres from song to song, melody remains as the unifying backbone of his voice. And the way he plays those melodies is highly personal. His blend of a hybrid picking style and an unconventional approach to playing chord-based melodies helps create a sound that's absolutely his own. And it's complimented by an unerring sense of rhythm developed on the first instrument he played as a youngster: drums.</p><p>""I've never had a guitar lesson, so my approach is entirely natural, ""Johnny notes."" His technique allows him to accent certain notes within his chords or during a melody line in the same way a traditional soul singer can push a note to a grittier or higher range for emotional effect.</p><p>Another factor in Johnny's distinctive sound is his choice of guitars. ""I've played all the classic makes and models over the years, but when I embarked on my solo career and was making Sometime Tuesday Morning I was looking for a guitar that had a rich, pure distinctive tone and a subtle vibrato arm that would allow me to end phrases like a singer, and that led me back to Gibsons,"" he recounts. Johnny's use of the Gibson Les Paul, ES-335, Firebird, and ES-295 models caught the Nashville-based company's attention. In fact, Johnny's unmatched sound so won over the Gibson staff that they were moved to produce a Johnny A. Signature Model.</p><p>""Creating an artist signature model guitar is not something we take lightly,"" says Gibson senior VP Rick Gembar. ""But sometimes a player comes along who is not only a musical innovator and artist of the highest-caliber, but has innovative ideas about designing a totally new instrument. And that's Johnny, who just knocked us off our feet.""</p><p>From gibson.com - Gibson Custom first introduced the Johnny A. Signature Model in 2003, and it's become one of the company's most successful and popular models. Developed in close collaboration with Johnny A., the Johnny A. Signature Model combines several innovative design aspects with many of Gibson's traditional appointments to deliver one of the world's most unique guitars.</p><p>""It's the first time an artist has been involved in every aspect of designing a new Gibson guitar model from scratch since the Barney Kessel in 1961,"" Johnny says. ""I've been a Gibson fan for a long time, but this is an honor I couldn't have imagined.""</p><p>Johnny's been getting that kind of reaction from fans and other musicians since he was in his teens, working his way up from playing pizza parlors to headlining now-historic Boston clubs like the Rat with his bands The Streets, Hidden Secret and Hearts on Fire. He also has the distinction of being the last guitar player to perform at the historic Boston Garden before its demolition.</p><p>Johnny's work as a sideman has taken him around the world, including a seven year stint leading legendary J. Geils Band frontman Peter Wolf's group and also co-producing Wolf's 1996 solo album Long Line, which garnered a four-star review in Rolling Stone.</p><p>When his gig with Wolf ended, Johnny began working on his solo career and Sometime Tuesday Morning. ""At the time, I thought it might be the last thing I ever recorded - maybe something for my daughter to listen to in the future so she'd know what her dad once did, ""Johnny says. ""To my surprise it sold 90,000 copies and launched this entire phase of my career. Besides my family, there's nothing I love more than being able to play my guitar and make a living with my creativity. I feel I'm on an amazing adventure - not only because this music has literally taken me to so many places, but because it takes me somewhere new every time I play.""</p><p>""Devotion to melodies, tight dynamics and succulent tones perfectly temper Johnny's balance of fire and ice."" <em>-Ted Drozdowski, Guitar World</em></p><p>""Johnny A. has eclectic musical vision and the skills to realize it...A.'s music is both accessible and sophisticated."" <em>-Ed Kopp, JAZZIZ</em></p><p>""Johnny A. has his own signature guitar--and seemingly scores of signature guitar sounds at his fingertips.

You may have never seen them on MTV, nor heard them on a Top 40 FM radio station, but with 5.5 million spins on Pandora, Barefoot Truth has quickly become a symbol of independent music success, and just may be 'the biggest band you've never heard of'. Mixing the sounds of folk, rock, jazz, and reggae, with lyrics full of unbridled optimism, the band has crafted a sound that is distinctly Barefoot Truth. Their 2010 studio album 'Threads', Barefoot Truth reached #21 on the iTunes Rock Charts, momentarily stepping ahead of bands such as Dave Matthews Band and The Fray. The new disc was noted as ""The best independently released album of 2010"" by ThisIsModern. Barefoot Truth happily credits Pandora Radio for their crucial role in growing the band's silent army of listeners.</p><p>Since taking the band 'full-time' in 2007, Barefoot Truth has earned spotlight attention on many levels, including an invitation to play at President Obama's pre-debate rally in New York, where they performed between Bruce Hornsby and Crosby and Nash.  They were asked to lend several songs from their new album 'Threads' to the upcoming 'Nature Propelled' film, in addition to scoring original music for the film. The band has also made appearances at major festivals such as Summerfest, 10,000 Lakes Festival, and FloydFest, in addition to tallying over 100 college and prepschool performances in the Northeast. Fans of Barefoot Truth can be confident that the quiet success of this small band will grow increasingly louder, one listener at a time...</p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/barefoot-truth/id121167155?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://www.twitter.com/barefoottruth,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/mcWPu0hStCI"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",436,Tieweb,http://www.myspace.com/tiewebband  ,,,http://www.tiewebmusic.com,0,"<p>Tieweb is an original rock band from Northern Virginia.

The name Thomas comes from the nickname we gave Jared, our drummer, after watching a cartoon.</p>",,,,,391,Roman Candle,http://www.myspace.com/romancandle,http://www.facebook.com/pages/roman-candle/15346435598,,http://www.romancandlemusic.com/,5045,"<p>Acclaimed rockers Roman Candle will release Oh Tall Tree in the Ear, their much-anticipated follow up to 2006's The Wee Hours Revue, May 12th, 2009 on Carnival Records.</p><p>""The songs and lyrics on this record grew out of us thinking about the relationship between what we hear, and what we desire,"" lead singer and guitarist, Skip Matheny, said about Oh Tall Tree.... On songs like ""Eden Was A Garden"" -- the album's opening track -- and ""They Say,"" listeners can hear those meditations on sound and longing play out for themselves.</p><p>The songs for this album were written mostly in a rural part of the U.K., despite the band being from Chapel Hill, NC. ""We had been playing shows in London after the Wee Hours came out, and we decided to stay for a month with some friends of ours who owned a manor house in east Yorkshire,"" says Matheny. ""We stayed in an apartment above what used to be the horse stables, and wrote a bunch of lyrics and music for the new record."" Matheny goes on to explain that the two major influences on them during this writing time, were Tom Stoppard's ""Rock 'n' Roll,"" which they had seen while in London, and Rainer Maria Rilke's ""Sonnets to Orpheus,"" which they were reading at the time.</p><p>Produced by Jason Lehning (Alison Krauss, The Silver Seas) and recorded in Nashville and North Carolina, Oh Tall Tree in the Ear capitalizes on the band's distinct melodic sensibilities and earnest, introspective lyrics. Skip, Timshel and Logan Matheny, the trio at the core of Roman Candle, remain a band dedicated to the power of a well-crafted song.<br /> <br />""We love the idea of a song, and people who write 'songs'."" says Matheny ""Cole Porter, Paul Westerberg, Joni Mitchell, the list is very long, but our favorite writers and bands seem to be dedicated to what a song is, and how to craft a good one.""</p><p>Touring has always been a strong point for Roman Candle, whose live show has been called ""jaw-dropping."" The band has toured with Rufus Wainwright, The Avett Brothers, Aimee Mann, The Whigs, Patti Smith, and Birdmonster. They also played NYC's world-famous Radio City Music Hall while supporting the Indigo Girls North American tour in 2006.</p><p>Roman Candle coalesced around the Matheny family: Skip, Logan, and Timshel (Skip and Logan are brothers, Skip and Timshel are married). They came together in Chapel Hill, a town where pop hooks and rural roots find friendly ears. Timshel was from Portland, OR, (a laboratory for progressive values) and the Matheny brothers from the Appalachian mountains (a repository for traditional ones).</p><p>Chapel Hill is a college town that celebrates its own southern authenticity, and was the perfect place for a band like Roman Candle to pop up. Time-tested wisdom about seamless musicianship between brothers certainly played out in Roman Candle's case: Skip's full-throated vocals and fiery guitar work meshed perfectly with Logan's rock solid drums. The warm sound of Timshel's Fender Rhodes and Farfisa organ became one of the most appealing elements of the band's distinctive sound, and are an integral part of Oh Tall Tree.... Already they were writing sharp-eyed, situational songs about daily life.</p><p>After releasing their debut, Says Pop (2002), Roman Candle took their ebullient, hard-edged sound on the road. The band developed into a formidable live act - critics have described their show as ""stunning"" -- and gathered a fervent nationwide following.</p><p>Rolling Stone picked up on Roman Candle's earthy pop around this time, calling them Chapel Hill's ""darling"" band on the rise. As the national buzz around them grew, the band connected with renowned Chapel Hill-based producer Chris Stamey (Yo La Tengo, R.E.M., Whiskeytown) to record The Wee Hours Revue (2006).  A collaboration with Stamey, the album retooled the songs on Says Pop, strengthening and expanding the band's sound. Timshel's deft keyboard work filled out the gaps between Skip and Nick Jaeger's hooky guitars, Jeff Crawford's buoyant bass and Logan's telepathic drums.</p><p>The new sound was a success. The album earned critical plaudits from many major media outlets. The Boston Globe called The Wee Hours ""a stunner."" Pitchfork's Grayson Currin said ""Roman Candle is one of the best, most complete American rock bands to surface in a decade."" Paste ranked the record #38 among the 100 best albums of 2006, while PopMatters said: ""...you need to hear Roman Candle. Go get The Wee Hours Review: because you can, and because it's damn good.""</p><p>Throughout 2006 and 2007, the band toured nationally and internationally to promote The Wee Hours Revue, appearing twice on Bob Harris' program on BBC Radio 2. Nearly a year after its release, the record was still attracting ecstatic praise in publications like Harp, which called it ""one of the sharpest roots-rock albums of the decade.""</p><p>On moving back to the U.S. with the new songs in hand, the band started recording and arranging the songs at their family studio in Wilkesboro, NC. In the new songs, the band's lyrics became even more complex, its appreciation of the ineffable more explicit. After signing with Nashville-based label Carnival Recording Company, Roman Candle continued to record, finishing the album that would become Oh Tall Tree in the Ear (the band boosted the title from Rilke's Sonnets to Orpheus), with producer Jason Lehning in Nashville over the last half of 2008.</p><p>With Oh Tall Tree in the Ear, the band's writing is at its most evolved, injecting a wry wit into their rollicking etudes on the human condition. At the end of Oh Tall Tree... Skip Matheny stands flat-footed in the gale of guitar noise that opens ""Early Aubade"" and as --at the top of his lungs -- he thanks the stars just for shining, you can hear him inviting you to share in the band's amazement at the world they live in. It's our world, too, and Roman Candle is here to remind us how lucky we are.</p>",,,,,387,Rocknoceros Happy Family Hour,,http://www.facebook.com/rocknoceros,http://vimeo.com/4064606,http://www.rocknoceros.com,16887,"<p><span style=""color: #ffffff;"">A  Rocknoceros Happy Family Hour is a night out for the WHOLE family!

You already know what the    rest of the country is starting to find out - that Rocknoceros is a gem    of a band.""</p><p>""An outstanding mix of folk and rock...literate songs...poppy    approach...multi-generational appeal."" - NPR, Best Music for Kids and    Families</p><p>As every family with youngsters in the DC area already knows,  Rocknoceros (pronounced like rhinoceros) is three guys: Coach Cotton,  Williebob, and Boogie Woogie Bennie. After seeing them perform, there is  no denying that they are not a typical trio. Coach Cotton is the  ring-leader, frequently immersed in a sea of knee-high concert goers.  Wearing a wireless head-set microphone, he wades through the mass of  dancing children, dispersing high-fives and shaking a tambourine.  Williebob provides the necessary string work for the show, moving among a  collection of guitars, mandolins, and banjos while wearing a kazoo  around his neck. Boogie Woogie Bennie is a one-man-band within the power  trio, employing a contraption that one four-year-old fan described as  ""the piano-drum"". The piano-drum allows Boogie Bennie to play the bass  drum with his right foot, the snare drum and hi-hat cymbal with his left  foot, and the keyboard with his hands (with his left hand playing the  bass parts). Together, Rocknoceros is able to cover a dizzying range of  musical styles in each set. From Tin Pan Alley to the shores of Jamaica,  Rocknoceros hops from genre to genre like a toad on summer asphalt.  Having already released three award-winning records, the new album tells  tales of the Colonel and his friends in their make-believe home of  Soggy Bog. The theme of ""Colonel Purple Turtle"" is one of friendship and  working together, a subject that matters to Coach, Boogie Woogie  Bennie, and Williebob, as the three members of Rockncoeros have been  best friends since they were children. The record reflects their abiding  trust in each other, and their desire to share the message of  camaraderie through song.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitu, ,,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/h7DecJGQvxo"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""300"" height=""182"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/LC9u_7CfIqY"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"385,Pete Francis (from Dispatch),http://www.myspace.com/petefrancis,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSNvPnKEc5g&eurl=http://www.myspace.com/petefrancis&feature=player_embedded,http://www.rcbands.com/petebft,5130,"<p>New York City based singer-songwriter, Pete Francis, is set to release his new album The Movie We Are In this May 2010. Whereas Francis' previous solo albums were largely self-produced, he uprooted his more traditional approach to album-making and assembled an entirely new crew with Los Angeles based producer Jeff Trott (right hand man to Sheryl Crow as writer and guitarist).</p><p>Says Francis, ""In the past I've worked with acoustic guitar, bass, drums, B3 organ, but I wanted to bring a modern electronic element into my music. When first speaking with Jeff Trott, I quickly realized he had great musical instincts and that he was getting my tunes. And then, he brought ideas to the table that I hadn't imagined. I saw a new musical landscape could be created with my songs by working with him.""</p><p>The musicians that Trott assembled for the recording sessions helped to create this colorful landscape. Having worked with artists such as Beck, Nine Inch nails, Gnarls Barkley, Willie Nelson, Queens of the Stone Age, Dr. Dre, and Scott Weiland, the musicians (Brian LeBarton, Justin Meldal-Johnsen, John O'Brien, Victor Indrizzo and others) provided an extraordinary musical palette of talent and sensibility.</p><p>When asked about the project, Trott says, ""It really became apparent to me that Pete was a very creative and colorful song-writer. What I liked was that there was this very good sense of Pete's personality from happy go lucky to dark and brooding. All these aspects were amazing to work with and the lyrics were very colorful. I think that's one of the things I really enjoy about Pete's songs... that it's sometimes hard to really figure out what the meanings are and I think that's missing in a lot of music - the mystery of what a song is.""</p><p>The opening track, ""Glue"", generates a feeling of weightlessness by combining organic instrumentation with futuristic sounds. This song solidly represents what's to follow on the album's consistent mix of fresh and classic, electronic and acoustic, known and unknown... Each listen unlocks a new guitar lick, synth riff, bass groove, drum program, live drumbeat or horn swell, and even the sounds of the sparsely used Ethiopian instrument cumbus. Midway through the album, the listener gets catapulted into the up-tempo and joyous revelry of ""Love Shakes You Down"" a sing-a-long with the familiar bell sounds of Motown combined with a string synth creating a modern and retro sound all at once. The slower, more melodic songs of the album like ""St. Paul's Fair"" and ""Didn't Know I Built It"" lure the listener into dream-states with rich deep vocals, sampled sounds from a town square in Italy, trance-like Wurlitzer pedaling, and vivid lyrics.</p><p>No one would deny that Francis has earned his stripes in the independent music scene. He formed the fiercely independent band Dispatch in 1995 whose uncommonly loyal fan-base bid them farewell at The Last Dispatch concert in 2004 with an attendance of 110,000 people from around the world. Since then, his career has infiltrated many musical worlds including performing his solo music at festivals around the country, reuniting with his Dispatch pals for three sold out nights at Madison Square Garden, having his solo music featured in films and television, and performing in the presence of Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C..</p><p>Commenting on his new album and departure from his Dispatch days, Francis says, ""It's good to get out of your comfort zone. I tried to let this motto resonate at every turning point of this record's evolution."" When asked if there is an overall theme to The Movie We Are In, Francis explains, ""I like to leave this up to the listener. Hearing an album is similar to visiting a museum. The listener has to have his or her own conversation with the artwork and create their own interpretations.""</p>",,,,,383,"Old School Freight Train ""Six Years"" CD Release",http://www.myspace.com/osft  ,http://www.new.facebook.com/event.php?eid=59370718241,http://www.youtube.com/osft,,1723,"<p>Over the last six years, Old School Freight Train has undergone just such an evolution.  Starting as a ""new grass"" band drawing strongly from the tradition of bluegrass innovators like David Grisman and Bela Fleck, the band continues to explore other musical paths. Songwriters like Elliott Smith and Tom Waits. Instrumentalists like Joshua Redman and Brad Mehldau. Rock bands like Radiohead and Wilco. With so many diverse influences, it's difficult to confine the band to one genre.</p><p>Tim Dickinson of Rolling Stone put it this way: ""Old School Freight Train is off on a timeless new track, blending roots and rock to create a sound that's all their own.""</p><p>In their conception, the members of OSFT, Jesse Harper (vocals &amp; guitar), Darrell Muller (bass), Nate Leath (fiddle), Nick Falk (drums) have recorded with mandolin master David Grisman, toured as Grisman's backup band, played countless headlining shows across the country; and been asked to cover songs by the likes of John Mayer, Wilco, and Coldplay for the popular bluegrass ""Pickin' On"" compilation series.</p><p>As much as virtuosic musicianship is important to each member (Harper a classically trained guitarist; Falk and Leath both students from Berklee School of Music), the band members have set their sights on writing memorable tunes. Harper, the band primary songwriter and singer, puts it this way:</p><p>""When you first start playing, you look up to the virtuosos and try to imitate that as much as possible. But once the novelty of virtuosity wears off, you start to think, &lsquo;these guys are great but what I really like is songs.""</p><p>That brings us to the new album, ""Six Years,"" out March 17th on the band's own 11:12 Records (distributed by Sony/RED).</p><p>From the Radiohead-tinged funk of ""Let Me Go,"" to the plaintive soul of ""Memphis,"" the focus here is on songs, not solos. While the disc is peppered with instrumental flourishes and masterful runs, it's Harper's heartfelt vocals that shine more than anything.</p><p>As a bonus, a rendition of Blondie's ""Heart of Glass"" turns the bouncy New Wave pop hit into an aching dirge about lost love that will likely and painfully repeat on your iPod all day.</p><p>To sum it up, Harper adds: ""We want to make good records that last, that you want to listen to more than once.""</p><p>With ""Six Years,"" Old School Freight Train has done just that.</p>",,,,,378,Ralph's World,http://www.myspace.com/allaroundralphsworld,https://www.facebook.com/Ralphsworld,http://www.youtube.com/user/RalphsWorldVideo,http://www.ralphsworld.com,11584,"<p><strong><a href=""http://www.zooglobble.com"" target=""_blank"">Zooglobble Recommended!</a>: ""I've seen lots of kids musicians - Ralph's World rocks with the best of them.

Coupled with that is his unnervingly candid approach to song-writing - the man is a burgeoning talent set for realisation with his latest studio release &lsquo;The Things You Think You Need'.<br /> <br />It's certainly refreshing to find an artist that refuses to simply dwell on the hard times, instead choosing to bask in the good and the great that life has to offer. At times almost jovial, Nash's charisma and buoyant attitude is infectious to the last with a sound capable of softening the sternest of hearts.<br /> <br />From the resplendent urgency of &lsquo;Hard Lesson' to the elegiac &lsquo;Barcelona', &lsquo;The Things You Think You Need' has the potential to surpass anything that's gone before. The writing/recording process for this, his fourth studio album, saw Nash's creative spark ignite like wild-fire as he wrestled with the concept of producing an album laden with variety and character.<br /> <br />By drawing inspiration from his own life experiences, both past and present, Nash's inspirational and evocative lyrical imagery possesses the ability to shatter those deep-rooted inadequacies and musters a feeling of liberation and new-found confidence. There's no sign of an agenda here - Nash's spirited folk revival offers salvation for the masses.<br /> <br />Too many of today's artists find it easy to trade on a manufactured kinship - creating an unsettling, short-term bond with audiences that they're all too willing to discard on a whim. Jay Nash is a different animal altogether and his desire to connect with people is evident as he produces that very first subtle, Americana-style chord.<br /> <br />There's no bravado, no ill-placed audacity.

In that hazy &lsquo;must do something' state, I moved to an apartment on top of a garage in the middle of the woods in Clifton, VA. I was reeling. Never before had I experienced such quiet in my external surroundings, nor had I ever experienced such chaos in my head and heart. This little apartment in the woods was all peace and serenity while my inside was a battleground, a war zone of sorts. Naming the new record I was about to start, "" All the Quiet, All the Chaos"" felt appropriate - and it was truth.</p><p>I enlisted my friend and crazy talented multi-instrumentalist, Tony Alany to co-produce the record with me. My super talented and great friend Brian (Thumbs) Keating, signed on to play bass. I would be making a record with people that I cared about and vice versa. I was comfortable and I trusted them.</p><p>What about the songs? I had about fifteen or so that I was considering at the time, and so we dove in. We started with the ""definites"" first, i.e. ""Nobody Tells You Anything,"" ""Hello Saturday Night,"" and ""Choices."" However, I had been writing and co-writing all along and the pool got bigger, so to speak. I set out to make a sad record, something ""real,"" but soon realized that was short sighted. What about the good in a relationship? What about the simple things like having someone to come home to and ask you about your day? What about knowing what it was like to love and be loved? What about hope? Isn't that ""real,"" too? Songs like ""Leave It All Behind"" and ""Three Days Later Tonight"" began to emerge. The record would now have more scope, regardless of my original almost singular emotional intentions. Everything was going as I intended. Well, almost. I moved to Nashville.</p><p>To say that moving to Nashville stopped the record in its tracks would not be a fair or complete picture. We also ran out of money. The combination of the two put the record on hold. Eight months went by. No progress, more writing. Then Tony emails me, ""we need to finish what we started."" The original twelve to fifteen song CD would now be nine songs.</p><p>I am proud of all the songs and so thankful for all involved in making it happen. I hope people like it, that's only natural I think. I have no idea what's next, and that's okay. Right now, I'm just excited for you to hear ""All the Quiet, All the Chaos.""

He received a Grammy nomination for Best Country Instrumental Performance 2001. A Titan of the Telecaster guitar (Guitar Player magazine May 1998 &amp; June 2002), he celebrates an American musical tradition where country music draws upon its origins in blues and bluegrass, and in the Western swing of Texas and California honky tonks. Bill Kirchen first gained renown as lead guitarist and a vocalist for Commander Cody &amp; his Lost Planet Airmen, the renegade country-rock band that tuned a whole generation of rock fans into the joys of unvarnished country, boogie and rockabilly. It was the resonant twang of Kirchen's battered Telecaster that drove ""Hot Rod Lincoln"" into the Top Ten in 1972. Kirchen has played guitar on recordings and performances with Gene Vincent, Link Wray, Danny Gatton, Emmylou Harris, Hoyt Axton, Nick Lowe and Elvis Costello.</p><p>In 2002 Bill Kirchen was inducted into the Washington Area Music Association Hall of Fame along with Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters, Nirvana) and John Phillip Sousa as well as winning 10 additional Wammies including Artist of the Year and Musician of the Year. In previous years, he won 2000 Rock/ Roots Rock Instrumentalist of the Year, Roots Rock Album (Raise A Ruckus) and 1999 Instrumentalist of the Year at the WAMA Awards, as well as being a multiple winner in 1997 and 1998, receiving ten awards, including Songwriter of the Year.

With that kind of classically trained background Enter The Haggis is constantly honing and evolving its sound - blending elements of rock and pop with traditional Celtic fare, an art school eclecticism and a keen sense of arrangement.  Past records have seen the band dabble in roots, funk, even adding prog rock elements to the mix, but ETH always manages to bring it home.  Alternating between upbeat rock numbers with sing-along choruses and slower, more introspective alt pop songs, the band plays progressive and lyrically driven music that's strongly rooted in Celtic tradition - from the storytelling to the bagpipes.</p>",http://www.enterthehaggis.com/music.cfm,,,,338,Dan Reed,http://www.myspace.com/danreed2012,,http://www.youtube.com/user/danreedvideos,http://www.danreed.com/,769,"<p>With Florida based LIQUID MUSIC GROUP's upcoming release of the new Dan Reed CD ""Coming up for Air"", Dan presents a group of songs that mirror this life journey.

It reads like a page out of a Dr. Seuss book, but for Mike Silverman, better known as That 1 Guy, it is just the reality he was searching for.</p><p>At 150-200 live shows each year people gather to see his mad scientist at work, curiously watching as That 1 Guy plugs an electric chord into the heel of a cowboy boot and transforms it into an instrument. He howls and the audience joins him like a pack of coyotes. They even chime in for the song ""Weasel Pot Pie,"" offering rhymes to finish a line about ""cinnamon scones"": Twilight Zones? Al Capones? Frank Stallones? That 1 Guy laughs and offers the grin of a Cheshire cat. Here is a man who loves his job.</p><p>Silverman's back story is not dissimilar to other musicians: he grew up a music geek, influenced by his jazz musician father, and enrolled in San Francisco Conservatory of Music before joining the jazz scene himself as a sought-after percussive bassist. This is where the similarities end, though, and where That 1 Guy began. ""In my case, being a bass player, I just felt very restricted by the instrument itself,"" he says. ""I've always wanted to sound different and have my own sound. I was headed that way on the bass, but for me to fully realize what I was hearing in my head sonically I was going to have to do it my way.""</p><p>That 1 Guy set off on his own, challenging the idea of what a one-man band can and should be. Rather than altering and adding on to the bass, he started from scratch, conceptualizing and creating the Magic Pipe. Standing at seven-feet-tall, the collection of swiveling pipes, metal gears, bass strings and electronic buttons forms the shape of a harp, but is played like a futuristic gutbucket.</p><p>With his curious instrument, creative performances and abundant talent, That 1 Guy soon caught the attention of promoters around the world and began touring heavily, wowing crowds at Big Day Out, Glastonbury, Monterrey Jazz Festival, Lowlands, Wakarusa and numerous other festivals. In 2007 he joined Guns &lsquo;N' Roses guitarist Buckethead on an American tour before headlining his own ""Mustaches and Laser Beams"" tour through North America.</p><p>Despite a demanding tour schedule, That 1 Guy has no plans on slowing down in 2010. His latest album PACKS A WALLOP! brings a new dimension to his work, thanks to new sounds and a new partnership with famed sound engineer Billy Hume (Nelly, Shop Boyz, Ying Yang Twins). Recorded at Hume's studio in Atlanta, GA, PACKS A WALLOP! stretches That 1 Guy's soundscapes further than ever, seamlessly combining hard-hitting rock (""Modern Man""), swampy blues (""Step Into Striped Light"") and electronic groove (""Funk Bean""). Hume's influence brings greater depth to the low frequencies and heavy beats. ""I'm really proud of what we did with the album,"" says That 1 Guy. ""It sounds closer to what I've been trying to do sonically since I started.""</p><p>This accomplishment required a new creative process. Whereas his last two albums, The Moon is Disgusting (2006) and Songs in the Key of Beotch (2000, re-released in 2004) were created from songs that he had already performed, That 1 Guy went into The Zone with nothing but ideas, sleeping on a mattress upstairs so he could sneak in to the studio whenever he felt inspired. ""I went in there with zero - nothing finished - and I lived at the studio for a month. It was really hard work, really long days, and I forced myself to craft some stuff."" The spontaneity, coupled with a tight window for completing the album, made all the difference.</p><p>""Human beings do our best work when we're challenged and pushed up against the wall,"" That 1 Guy explains. ""By nature, we're hunters and gathers, spending each day looking for next meal. It's easy to be lazy when you don't have to come up with something creative right away.""</p><p>His creativity continues with a new tour in support of PACKS A WALLOP! Along with the Magic Pipe, expect to see the Magic Saw and Magic Flute, as well as magic tricks. ""I had never seen a magic show until about two years ago,"" That 1 Guy confesses. ""I had no interest in it-but now I just love it. I'm like a twelve-year-old,"" incorporating magic tricks seamlessly into live performances, even using a playing card in place of a traditional pick. ""So much of my music has miraculous qualities to it because it's hard to tell what's going on. There are lots of slights of hand and sonic misdirection. It feels like I was meant to do magic.""</p><p>Strange? Perhaps. But as Billboard noted, ""In the case of Mike Silverman's slamming, futuristic funk act... the normal rules of biology just don't apply."" It suits That 1 Guy just fine.</p><p>""I like being my own person,"" he says. ""I didn't set out to be a weirdo but I'm starting to embrace it.""</p>",,,,,303,"Dave Barnes ""What We Want, What We Get"" CD Release",http://www.myspace.com/davebarnes,,http://www.youtube.com/user/THEdavebarnes,http://davebarnes.com/,5133,"<p>As singer/songwriter Dave Barnes tells it, he had a Harry Potter moment while in college.

But just a few years later, after crisscrossing the country and selling vanloads of two independent albums-Brother, Bring The Sun and Chasing Mississippi, the artist had landed songs on television and in films, and was well known to thousands who'd discovered his soulful, supple way with a melody, wrapping itself around a lyric that sneakily burrows under the skin. Those fans include Vince Gill and Amy Grant (who made guest appearances on Chasing Mississippi) and John Mayer, who said on his blog: ""Go where this guy is taking you. My man's aim is true!""</p><p>Where is Barnes taking listeners? Judging by a spin of his latest, Me and You and the World, just about anywhere. The Steely Dan jazz-pop of ""Someday."" The Blind Boys of Alabama-style gospel of ""Carry Me Through."" The lighters-in-the-air sing-along chorus of ""When A Heart Breaks."" The crowd favorite and first single, ""Until You."" Or, perhaps, the delicate, cello-laced ballad of ""On A Night Like This."" It's all here.</p><p>""I always want my songs to be served individually,"" Barnes says. ""As we approach production, what I'm always the most conscious of is, &lsquo;is this song sounding like it needs to sound?' I do want the record to sound good, but I'm a lot more concerned with an individual song. That's all that anybody's listening to at one point anyway.""</p><p>Me and You and the World refers to Barnes' expanded lyrical perspective. Profoundly affected by his work with the Mocha Club (mochaclub.org)-which builds orphanages and supplies medical care in Africa-and service trips he's taken to the continent, the songwriting began shifting. As he says, ""You can beat your fans up when you write about yourself all the time. I never want them to be like &lsquo;okay, give us a break you egomaniac.' Now I love to write about my experiences, but I think this record is much more about realizing there are so many other stories to tell.""</p><p>Born in South Carolina, Barnes grew up in rural Mississippi, first gravitating to the hip-hop popular with his classmates (first CD: Young MC), then latching on to the soul, blues and soulful rock favored by his Jackson-born mother and Clarksdale-born father. ""We listened to so much Motown and old school R&amp;B. That was just completely normal for Dad, growing up in that world. He's told me so many stories of being in Clarksdale, going down to the City Hall and seeing these amazing bands playing.""</p><p>Newly arrived in Nashville, armed with just his acoustic guitar, Barnes gravitated to the folk scene.  After playing his fair share of solo acoustic shows, though, Dave made has way back to his roots, and found himself looking for music with both depth and groove. This lead Barnes to embrace Stevie Wonder, Steely Dan and seemingly everything in between. ""I've been on a massive Toto kick lately,"" he shares, gleefully, just after communicating his affection for Phil Collins' melodies in Invisible Touch-era Genesis.</p><p>This would be a good time to mention that it's a bad idea to take Barnes seriously all of the time, or perhaps most of the time. A YouTube search turns up almost as many homespun comedy clips as fan-shot performances. In fact, Barnes has a stand-up comedy sideline, selling out a 350-seat Nashville theater for a show that included no guitars. ""I just remember, in the middle of the routine, thinking, &lsquo;this is maybe the most fun I've ever had.' Because it was working well and people were responding.""</p><p>A sense of humor also helps when arduously building an independent career. ""You get a lot of &lsquo;hey, yeah, come play at the college-you can play in the cafeteria while people are eating.' And it's like, &lsquo;yesss!' &lsquo;And you're staying with a student.' &lsquo;Oh, great.' And there were those shows where you're like, &lsquo;oh my gosh, am I really playing in a basement?'""</p><p>Once earning a following though, Barnes played shows for years before he realized that often his audiences were singing every word of his songs along with him. ""When I play, I'm so in the zone that I don't really pay attention,"" admits the artist, who performed hundreds of shows while still unsigned. ""It's only recently that I've appreciated that. Now, there are a couple of places in the set where I stop singing the song and let the audience sing. Not having a radio presence (yet), and being able to play places where people are singing songs loudly, it's pretty amazing.""</p><p>Amazing, yes, but not unexpected, given Barnes' talent and stage presence. The response also speaks to the power of his songs, equal parts depth and hooks, both thought-provoking and dance-inspiring. It's so contagious that even newcomers have been known to join in.  Barnes recalls, ""there I was, three years ago in a room just writing a song because it needed to be written-and here I am today in a room in front of 500 to 1,000 people with everybody singing it. And that's a weird feeling.""</p><p>Despite Nashville's reputation as a cutthroat industry town, best known for commercial country and Christian music, a group of young, pop-oriented singer/songwriters is simultaneously thriving. Barnes counts locals like Matt Wertz (with whom he's toured), sometime-McCartney keyboardist Gabe Dixon and Mat Kearney as friends and peers. It's a non-competitive, supportive community, he says, but the peer pressure is definitely there.</p><p>""The great thing about being in Nashville is that you've got to constantly write stuff that keeps your friends on their toes,"" he says. ""I've got so many talented friends that I don't want to be the guy where everyone says: &lsquo;Did you hear Dave's new record? Isn't it, um, interesting?'""</p><p>Strangely enough, Barnes never made a conscious decision to arrive where he is today. As he puts it, one thing just led to another, without much of a master plan. ""I am thankful that many young singer/songwriters ask me, &lsquo;dude, how did you do it? Give me the roadmap.' But the truth is,' I don't know.' I can't tell you that I've ever planned anything. And I like that, because it must mean I am meant to do this. Right?""</p><p>Undoubtedly, Barnes' enthusiastic audience agrees.</p>",,,,,301,The Dirty Heads,http://www.myspace.com/dirtyheads  ,,http://www.youtube.com/dirtyheads,,691,"<p>""We want to be positive and entertain,"" says Dirty Heads vocalist Jared Watson.

Pursuing a more collaborative process and having added a more lush production to his singer- songwriter roots, the new album proves to be a great showcase for his powerful and emotional voice.</p><p>The Spokane, WA native's desire to &lsquo;open up the process' found him traveling to London to work with a circle of songwriters/musicians who aligned with Wells' musical direction.  ""Half of the album was done in London and the other half completed here in the states,"" says Wells.  ""I didn't know what kind of record I was going to make before I got to London, but something just seemed to click while I was there that really defined what I wanted to do with this album.""  Invoking a cathartic creative process from the very beginning for Remain, the songwriter penned an astounding 60 songs for the record.</p><p>Tyrone worked with songwriter/producer Martin Terefe (Jason Mraz, KT Tunstall, James Morrison) and Iain Archer (UK indie artist and Snow Patrol co-writer) in the UK, and Tim Myers (formerly of OneRepublic), David Hodges (formerly of Evanescence) and Matt Scannell (Vertical Horizon) in the U.S.  Creating a work that manages to be more guitar-edged than previous Wells' efforts - but still unabashedly soul-baring - he appreciated huddling with collaborators like Terefe, who - like Wells - is a big believer in trusting one's instincts.  ""We had great chemistry together.""  ""Losing Ground,"" one of a handful of production/songwriting collaborations between Wells and Terefe, was written and demoed in less than 3 hours during their first writing session together.</p><p>Wells has found himself on a new musical path on his second Universal Republic effort, but he continues to display the same gritty determination and work ethic that has enabled him to chart his own course from the very beginning.  Wells launched his career unveiling his first indie release with the take-me-as-I-am motif of 2003's Snapshot.  An in-demand live offering followed in 2005: Close: Live at McClain's, (the coffeehouse where he established his raved-about live rep) capturing the singer's unique intimacy with an audience.</p><p>Soon, major labels came calling.  ""All of a sudden, after five years of doing everything on my own steam I had all these labels interested,"" says Wells.  His 2007 release, the soulful Hold On, was originally his third indie record.  The album was picked up by Universal Republic and released untouched as his major label debut.</p><p>The buzz surrounding Wells' inspiring wealth of songs was also beginning to land him song placements in films and TV shows.  To date Tyrone has had significant placements including  ""One Tree Hill,"" ""Everyone's Hero,"" ""Rescue Me,"" ""Ghost Whisperer,"" ""Numbers,"" ""Criminal Minds,"" ""Army Wives,"" ""What About Brian,"" ""The 50 Greatest Moments at Madison Square Garden"" and the ""Rails &amp; Ties"" trailer.</p><p>Wells is particularly proud that Remain has carried him into some undiscovered territories.  His voice continues to set him apart and his passion is demonstrated on this new album.  ""With constant touring it's important to believe in what you're singing every night.  I'm excited about this new material and believe in these songs.

In fact, his smiling visage - he was, after all, a member of the Small Faces and the Faces - would serve as an ideal illustration in the proverbial Dictionary of What Is Truly Cool.</p><p>The man known to his many mates and even more fans and admirers as 'Mac' is the sort who shrugs off such puffery. And then he just carries on creating splendid and genuine rock'n'roll with his Bump Band as well as musically aid and abet a marquee line-up of truly blue ribbon talent that he has toured and recorded with: The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Bonnie Raitt, Bruce Springsteen, Taj Mahal, John Hiatt, David Lindley, Paul Westerberg, Billy Bragg and Patty Griffin, to name some but hardly all of the notables that McLagan has worked with over his four-plus decade career.</p><p>He has also etched his distinctive musical talents onto the playlist of rock'n'roll history co-writing such Faces hits as Cindy Incidentally, You're So Rude and Three Button Hand Me Down. His Wurlitzer electric piano is heard on everything from Stay With Me by the Faces to the smash hit Miss You by The Rolling Stones, and Mac's trademark Hammond B-3 organ is featured on the Small Faces classic Itchycoo Park and Rod Stewart's Maggie May and You Wear It Well.</p><p>McLagan entered the music game in Swinging London in the mid-1960s, and you can read all about it in his vivid and delightful memoir, All The Rage, a book that The Express hailed as ""One of the best music books in years."" He ascended from the Top of the Pops with Small Faces to the pinnacle of rock with the Faces when Rod Stewart and Ron Wood joined the band. The rollicking Faces ruled 1970s album radio and sales charts as well as the stadiums, arenas and festivals around the world, leaving countless satisfied fans, many wild tales and more than a few quivering hotel managers in their wake. Whether McLagan is singing, writing and playing his own music or as the go-to guy for a session or tour, he has been and remains the quintessence of rock'n'roll.</p><p>Since he cut his debut solo album, Troublemaker, in 1979 - with two Rolling Stones (Keith Richards and Ron Wood) and a Beatle (Ringo Starr) among the players - McLagan has been making music in his own right that carries on the British rock tradition that he helped establish with the Small Faces and Faces on the albums Bump In The Night (1980), Best Of British (2000) and Rise &amp; Shine! (2004). ""It's all raw, up front, in your face, rollicking greasy good-time music done by a master,"" says All Music Guide of Rise &amp; Shine!</p><p>In 2006, he released a touching tribute to his old bandmate, Spiritual Boy: An Appreciation of Ronnie Lane, acclaimed by the Dallas Observer as ""a warm &amp; fitting salute to one of rock's sadly unsung master songwriters and a must-have disc."" Spiritual Boy has garnered chart success in Mojo and leaves a trail of glowing reviews in Rolling Stone, No Depression, Uncut, and Goldmine.</p><p><br />Awarded the prestigious Ivor Novello Award in 1996 for his outstanding contributions to British music and inducted into the Texas Music Hall of Fame in 2004, McLagan is beloved by musicians and music lovers alike. He produced the Faces four CD boxed set, Five guys walk into a bar... for Rhino Records, and received a rare honor on April 6th, 2006, when it was proclaimed Ian 'Mac' McLagan Day in Austin Texas. But rather than rest on his laurels, Ian McLagan continues to do what he has always done best: rock'n'roll.</p><p>In December of 2007 Ian 'Mac' McLagan and Glyn Johns, his old pal from Small Faces and Faces days, met at Sphere Studios in London to mix and master Ian McLagan's beautiful and emotionally raw CD, Never Say Never. The self produced and directed album features McLagan's award winning Bump Band: 'Scrappy' Jud Newcomb, Don Harvey and Mark Andes, and includes all original songs written by one of the best-loved musicians of our time. Patty Griffin graces Never Say Never with her soulful vocals and she and the Tosca Strings can be heard on the final track, the heart wrenching When The Crying Is Over. McLagan recorded and produced Never Say Never at The Doghouse Studios in Manor, Texas, and recorded Where Angels Hide on the Steinway in The Edythe Bates Old Chapel at The International Festival-Institute in Round Top, Texas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,276,The Fred Eaglesmith Traveling Show,http://www.myspace.com/dredeaglesmith,http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001064237928,http://youtu.be/MdUAjwHWYSI,http://www.fredeaglesmith.com/,12450,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />Eaglesmith has forged one of the most distinguished and unique independent careers in popular music from the grassroots upwards, marked by a consistent string of critical superlatives for his work.

friends Todd Wright, Chip Johnson, Bryan Dawley, Daniel Brindley, Taylor Carson and more! In a rare headlining performance, this prolific singer/songwriter shares the evening with an amazing line-up of local talent. Drawing on songs from his 7 album releases, Luke Brindley &amp; Friends showcase the reflective lyrics and heartbreakingly honest perspective that garnered him multiple Washington Area Music Association nominations for Songwriter of the Year. Equally at home on the stage, The Washington Times says of his live performance ""no song goes untouched by the energy and pure infectious joy of Luke's performance...a mastery of pop songcraft and stagecraft.""</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Falbum%252Fa-hidden-wholeness%252Fid390474025%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://twitter.com/lukebrindley,,271,Mae, http://www.myspace.com/mae ,,http://whatismae.com/maetv,http://www.whatismae.com,1434,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>After three full-length albums between both independent and major record labels and over 500,000 in worldwide sales, MAE have a new purpose and a new partner - their fans. With the help of the band's international community, MAE --lead vocalist DAVE ELKINS, guitarist ZACH GEHRING, AND, drummer JACOB MARSHALL, have embarked on a year-long journey to help those less fortunate and raise awareness about important humanitarian issues. Absent a label and management, the band is seizing the opportunity to redefine their success, change the lives of those in need, and spread their message through music and the MAE community.</p><p>As a part of a year-long campaign, MAE will release a new song exclusively on their website every month during 2009. When fans visit the band's website--WHATISMAE.COM, they will be able to hear the music for free. Every song will be available as a digital download for a minimum donation of $1. For the duration of 2009, MAE will commit all of the profits from digital downloads to fund humanitarian projects that the band and their fans will be a part of all year long. MAE's first project is in conjunction with Habitat For Humanity International. The band's goal is to raise $65,000 in donations to fully fund the construction of a home for Rhonda Floyd and her three children in Newport News, VA. Throughout the course of the project, MAE will document their progress as a home for Rhonda and her family is built.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",,,,,268,Nico Vega,http://www.myspace.com/nicovega  ,,,,0,"<p>Nico Vega represents a modern day saint. A warrior that has led us to a more fulfilling, lighter way of being. She represents people and unity. She fights for all of us and teaches us to fight for each other. She is an idea that has evolved into a message and she fuels us in our bellies. She is the person we are all capable of being, but she holds the bar high above our head so that we must reach to be better human beings.</p>",,,,,267,The Von Bondies,http://www.myspace.com/vonbondies,,,,0,"<p>For The Von Bondies, the most important reason to make music isn't a complicated one. ""We're here to entertain people so they forget that they have a 9 to 5 job to go to in the morning,"" says Jason Stollsteimer, the Michigan-based band's singer-songwriter-guitarist. ""We love what we do or else we wouldn't do it; it's for us and the fans.""<br /><br />With the February 2009 release of Love, Hate and Then There's You, the Von Bondies' third studio album and their debut for Majordomo Records (a division of Shout! Factory), those fans will experience a band that's come a long way since 2004's smash album Pawn Shoppe Heart. Now in their ninth year together, Stollsteimer and drummer Don Blum, the Von Bondies' other founding member, have taken their music to new places while holding on to the core values they've always exhibited.</p>",,,,,264,Mambo Sauce,  http://www.myspace.com/mambosauce

Sauce. This electrifying group takes their name from the mystery sauce popular at Chinese/Soul Food carry - outs throughout DC. Just as nobody really knows what&iacute;s in Mambo Sauce (the sauce), Mambo Sauce&iacute;s (the band) musical virtuosity will always keep you guessing as to what&iacute;s coming next. Comprised of seven of DC&iacute;s most proficient, young musicians, Mambo Sauce has created a new form of music, &igrave;Pocket&icirc; that effectively blends DC Go - Go percussion with well crafted songs, explosive raps and sultry melodies.<br /> <br /> Put Go - Go music, Kanye West, No Doubt and Outkast in a blender. Blend until the top pops off, and that might scratch the surface of where Mambo Sauce is going. As Techno, House, Trance and Jungle are all forms of Dance music, and Dub, Dancehall and Ska are all variations of Reggae, ""Pocket"" is likewise a new, but similar form of Go - Go. By incorporating elements of a variety of music ranging from Latin to Soul, Hip - Hop to Rock into their songs, Mambo Sauce puts their individual stamp on the genre. As the only existing Go - Go band playing all original music at present, Mambo Sauce and their label Red C Records intend to use ""Pocket"" music, to infiltrate the international music market with the DC Go - Go sound.<br /> <br /> Mambo Sauce is currently hard at work on their debut album. Recording in Baltimore at Wright Way Studios (Dru Hill, Mario, Evan Taubenfeld (Guitarist for Avril Lavigne), Fertile Ground, Hezekiah Walker, 2 Live Crew, Crystal Waters) with head engineer/producer, Steve Wright and is due for release in 2009.<br /> <br /> This talented, young group of musicians has come together with a burning desire to see Go - Go music make its mark outside of DC. After almost 30 years of being the dominant force in urban music throughout the region, Go - Go's time to become internationally recognized is now, and Mambo Sauce has the drive and the ability to make it happen!</p>",http://mambosauceband.com/music/ ,,,,261,Crash Boom Bang,http://www.myspace.com/crashboombang ,,,,1074,"<p>After a year of selling out local shows and building buzz in the Northern Virginia area, Crash Boom Bang took their electric live show to the road in 2008, sharing the stage with acts like Plain White Ts and Mayday Parade. In 2008, the band recorded a full length album in Los Angeles with Tom Higgenson of Plain White Ts producing.<br /><br />Gold Rush, the debut album from Crash Boom Bang, is a meticulously crafted blend of rock and pop, driven by soaring vocal melodies and unforgettable guitar leads.

Steve blends participatory songs, clever stories and great melodies to create what the Boston Globe called ""not just a musical journey but an entertaining, interactive and educational one."" A rising star on the national kids' music scene, Steve has delighted audiences throughout the country, including at prestigious venues like Symphony Space in New York City, Wolftrap in Vienna VA, the Kennedy Center and the White House in Washington, D.C., and Fenway Park in Boston. Anyone who's attended a SteveSongs concert appreciates Steve's ability to connect with his audience - from the exuberant children flocking towards the stage, to the moms bouncing babies with the beat, to the parents and grandparents singing and grooving along. It's no wonder he's been called a modern day Pied Piper!</p><p>In May 2008, Steve took on the exciting new role of ""Mr. Steve,"" cohost of the PBS KIDS preschool destination that features the popular shows Curious George, Clifford the Big Red Dog, Dragon Tales, and Super Why. Steve performs original interactive songs that reinforce the day's curriculum theme. Steve wrote his first children's song back in 1997 for his brother, then a first grade teacher. Positive feedback and inspiration quickly followed, leading Steve to record his first album, Morning 'Til Night, in 1999. That same year Steve left his job as a business consultant with Accenture to pursue this adventure full time. Eleven years and 6 albums later, Steve has performed at over 3000 shows across the country. He's won numerous prestigious awards, including 2 Parents' Choice Gold Awards, a Nappa Honor, 2 iParenting Media Awards, and 2 Children's Music Web Awards. His current and critically acclaimed CD is Marvelous Day (2006). Combining his two passions, music and kids, has yielded what Steve calls ""the coolest job ever.""</p><p>Steve's signature songs are educational and entertaining, silly, but always seriously good music. According to Steve, ""The experiment from the beginning was making music that both kids and parents would enjoy, so that it could really be a full family experience.""</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong></strong></p>",http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/stevesongs/id174885074?uo=4&partnerId=30,,http://www.twitter.com/SteveSongs,,250,Politicks Reunion,,http://www.facebook.com/Politicks,,,15136,"<p>Genre-blending DC rockers Politicks have steadily built their following not only by consistently evolving their sound but by putting on an energetic live show filled with rock, soul, and plenty of groove.

From setting out as Dublin songwriter circuit regulars, to building a devoted cult following in the U.S. with warm embraces from media and competitive iTunes charting, the band has captivated audiences and tastemakers on both sides of the pond and undergone considerable personal growth along the way. <br /> <br />The band's forthcoming album, The Universe Is Laughing, might just be its most artistically mature piece of work to date.  A lyrical journey through life's beautiful mysteries, the record sees Kevin and Mick further develop themes of self-discovery and enlightenment they first visited on 2009's Happy The Man. <br /> <br />""Perhaps what is different this time round is that those ideas are less visible at first glance,"" said primary songwriter Kevin May. ""But listen to the title track &lsquo;The Universe Is Laughing,' a paean to the mystery of the passage of time and our brief but beautiful existence. Or hear Mick's powerful vocal on &lsquo;Concentrate.' He starts out a wounded lover but in the second verse he's transfigured and sounds like a prophet, one who should be listened to."" <br /> <br />The Guggenheim Grotto emerged in 2005 to critical acclaim in Ireland with its debut album ...Waltzing Alone when the first single ""Told You So"" reached No. 12 on the Irish National Airplay Charts. Later the band found success abroad much in part to early champions like David Dye at WXPN in Philadelphia, XM Radio's ""The Loft"" and Nic Harcourt at KCRW in Los Angeles. ...Waltzing Alone eventually spent weeks at the No. 1 spot on the iTunes Folk Chart in April 2007 after the opening track ""Philosophia"" was chosen as iTunes Free Single of the Week. The song was also featured on the first generation iPhone as a sample song on test models in stores and ""Told You So"" made it onto a Starbucks Hear Music sampler alongside Damien Rice, James Blunt and Amy Winehouse <br /> <br />Two years later The Guggenheim Grotto released Happy The Man as an iTunes exclusive in October 2008, and the album quickly rose again to No. 1 on the iTunes Folk Chart.  January 2009 saw the physical release, and the band spent much of the year traversing these United States to promote it - from playing listening rooms across the country to large festivals, performing on nationally syndicated programs like E-Town in Boulder, CO and Charleston, WV's Mountain Stage and opening dates with Ani DiFranco and They Might Be Giants. The album received tremendous support from Triple A radio, several songs made their way into major network primetime TV shows like One Tree Hill and Brothers And Sisters, and a YouTube featured video for the first single, ""Her Beautiful Ideas,"" garnered over 160,000 views in just a few days. <br /> <br />Now, poised to release its third album in June 2010, The Guggenheim Grotto firmly holds its ground with a new offering sure to please fans and critics alike. A record largely written and recorded in hotels and living rooms while crossing this wide country on tour, The Universe Is Laughing is an ode to lovers and madmen as much as a shout out to carnival hucksters and easy mystics.  It celebrates the joy of falling in love and then forgetting what all the fuss was about.  It preaches sticking to your guns, fighting the good fight and standing with your hands hung loosely by your side. It's about marching, chopping wood, highways, girls wearing pretty dresses, sinking churches, ghost towns, chasing answers, getting drunk, rabbits and weasels, tiny white lies, the sun, the moon and the whole damn universe.  It's about dancing in the grey. <br /> <br />Standout tracks like the album's upbeat first single ""Wisdom"" or the title track and ukulele tune ""The Universe Is Laughing"" juxtapose heady concepts, compelling melodies and accessible lyrics.  The former challenges a list of guidelines society gives us to find happiness and righteousness with the chorus ""I listen and I hear what's said/ I follow it from A to zed/ But wisdom hasn't found me yet,"" complete with ironically sunshine-y la-la-la-la-las. <br /> <br />In ""Ruby Heart,"" excitable new love gives way to its senses and learns patience, while ""Trust Me I'm A Thief,"" cautions on the sometimes brutal honesty of our true nature.  The Bowie-esque ""Wings And Feathers"" pays tribute to Jack Kerouac-inspired mad indulgences with lyrics drunk on love and life.  ""Tonight we take this city/ The marrow and the fringes/ We'll set our dogs on beauty/ We're growing wings and feathers,"" May croons in the chorus over a bed of blissful and popping synths. <br /> <br />With equal amounts melancholy and jubilance, The Universe Is Laughing is a celebration of universal truths and the mysteries of humanity.  The duo's signature mix of timeless folk, soaring melodies and emotionally intelligent lyrics remains intact while Kevin and Mick delve deeper to search for meaning within themselves. <br /> <br />The Universe Is Laughing will be released on United for Opportunity in June 2010.  The band will spend a significant amount of time in the U.S. to support it and plans to tour through the rest of the year.</p>",http://www.guggenheimgrotto.com/?page_id=8,,,,235,Justin Roberts and The Not Ready for Naptime Players,http://myspace.com/justinrobertsmusic4kids,http://facebook.com/justinrobertsmusic4kids,http://www.justinroberts.org/video.php,http://www.justinroberts.org,11307,"<p><strong><a href=""http://www.zooglobble.com"" target=""_blank"">Zooglobble Recommended!</a>: ""Roberts has few peers in his songwriting for kids and families; he and his band are as great live as they are on record.""</strong></p><p><br /><br />Justin Roberts is truly one of the ""all-stars"" of the indie family music scene.

Mutual friends spent years telling both men they should try writing songs together, an idea they continually brushed off until they began running into each other at a local coffee shop near both their homes in San Diego's North County.</p>",,,,,183,The Chuck Shaffer Picture Show,http://www.myspace.com/thechuckshafferpictureshow,,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3x0OyZB-e8,,5948,"<p>The Chuck Shaffer Picture Show, based out of Harrisonburg, VA, officially formed as a band a little more than a year ago.

Jim's Big Ego's secret to awesomeness is singer, songwriter, and all around super-genius, Jim Infantino. Armed with the innate ability to create songs that are more brilliant than all others in history, Infantino gives the band the gift of greatness. Jim's Big Ego compares itself to such major players as The Great Wall of China, The Grand Canyon, Antarctica, and other things you can see from space. While the debate still rages over whether the band's formation was a matter of divine providence or historical inevitability, one fact remains clear: if the world ended today, Jim's Big Ego would die happy knowing that they were more talented than Oasis, more popular than Terence Trent D'Arby and richer than MC Hammer.</p>",http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fjims-big-ego%252Fid4255150%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30,,http://www.twitter.com/jimsbigego,"<iframe width=""300"" height=""233"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/aC551c5upgI"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",182,Chris Pureka,http://www.myspace.com/chrispureka,,,,0,"<p>On Tuesday, January 20th 2009, Chris Pureka released her 2nd EP (her 4th album) Chimera.

About Pureka's Official CMJ Showcase (NYC OCTOBER 2008) The New York Times said, ""An interviewer asked Chris Pureka to sum up her music as a haiku. I will: Folky sorrowful songs of loneliness and hurt, longing to reunite. Her tunes have the grave Appalachian flavor of Neil Young and Gillian Welch; her guitar playing is subdued but quietly virtuosic. And her voice can be a desolate whisper or a bitter accusation. There's no comfort, for her, in the clarity of her observations.""

His journey began with little more than a raw desire to understand life and the world around him, but it was not long until this led him to his calling: music. He found inspiration in the passionate screams of Qawals, eastern spiritual singers such as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan; through the intoxicating musical journeys of Ravi Shankar; and through the irresistible pop beats and powerhouse guitar bands, such as U2, of the west.</p><p>Nero surrounded himself with music, and it became a fundamental part of his life as he grew up. Through high school chorus and music lessons as well as fronting several small bands, he began to recognize the knowledge and experience that he lacked, leading him to pursue an arts education at the New World School of the Arts in Miami, Florida. There, he studied musical theatre to gain a more comprehensive understanding of performance and communication while continuing to develop his voice.</p><p>In the years that followed, Nero departed from his life in the arts to work in the financial industry, but music never left him. While working hard to achieve the financial independence necessary to pursue his dreams, he constantly found himself scribbling down pieces of lyrics and music, whenever and wherever inspiration struck. He gradually amassed material until, in May of 2003, the moment had arrived. He embarked on a four-year journey of self-expression, experimentation, and determination that culminated in the release of ""Nine."" Nero's autobiographical debut is the product of a life driven by music.</p>",,,,,174,Debris,,,,http://www.debrismusic.net/,576,"<p>Debris is a four-piece band &ndash; drums, 2 guitars, bass.
