Her aching and yearning for more is apparent in her music and may just be the drive that takes her to far places.Though one may hear some pop and folk sensibilities, the ""pop"" or ""folk"" category do not quite pinpoint Lee's sound. Her dynamic voice can calm you like lullaby and then surprise you when she lifts into a high soar. In her live performances, she incorporates the looper pedal to layer sweet, haunting vocal harmonies. Her lyrics are simple yet rich with meaning. Whatever genre it is, Lee's sound is soothingly addictive.With the ambition of wanting to put her music in people's hands, Lee partnered with Pledge Music in late 2010 to campaign the funding of her first EP. With much success, her fans prevailed and thus Lee was able to start recording with Kevin Gutierrez at Assembly Line Studios in Vienna, VA. Lee co-produced the album with Gutierrez and her bass player, Posido Vega. The album was released digitally in April 2011.<br /><a href=""http://www.amandaleemusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/amandaleemusic"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/TheAmandaLeeMusic"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Famanda-lee%252Fid216585281%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/amandaleemusic"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",17859,$10 advance/$13 day of,"4pm - The new Lobby Bar opens5pm - Doors6pm - @JamnJavaDoorGal's LOCAL SCENE",11/24/12 22:00An Evening with Tom Russell,,,0,,,16613,$22 advance/ $25 day of,"5pm - The new Lobby Bar opens6pm - Doors7pm - ShowAfter The Show - Lobby Bar stays open!",11/18/12 23:00Lucy Wainwright Roche + Lindsay Fuller,,,17674,,,17675,$12 ,"5pm - The new Lobby Bar opens6pm - Doors7pm - Lucy Wainwright Roche + Lindsay Fuller ",11/17/12 23:00Ellis Paul,,,0,,,15053,$20 ," 5:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens6:30 - Doors7:30 - Ellis Paul",11/16/12 23:30Matt Wertz (at The Hamilton),,,0,,,16902,$25 ,,11/15/12 23:30Derek Webb,Page CXVI,,0,,"<p><strong>PAGE CXVI</strong><br />Page CXVI is a project started with the idea of making hymns accessible and known again.

Drawing on influences from modern artists like Jack Johnson and Jamie Cullum, as well as paying tribute to classic greats Johnny Cash and Frank Sinatra, Kent's perfectly mellifluous tunes are roll-the-windows-down, soak-up-some-sun kind of good. Since the release of his debut album ""Neoteny,"" the singer-songwriter is currently collaborating with his trio, Jamie Kent &amp; The Options, to cultivate a sound with a strong folk and jazz influence. In the past year they have toured extensively across the US, playing over 200 shows throughout 40 states. Additionally, they have received national radio play on over 120 stations, and recently signed licensing agreements with MTV, VH1, Bravo, and The Discovery Network! Reviews of Kent's music have stated that he ""possesses a great voice and a fearlessness to be admired as he drifts through glimpses of blues, jazz, and rock notes that suggest Steely Dan influences without being derivative."" He has been called a troubadour, entrepreneur, and vocal sensation. ""With an authentic voice that often evokes the moaning grooveness of Chicago's Bobby Lamm, he's got tremendous range, a unique playfullness, and a certain fearlessness.

The new album was released in North America on May 1st 2012 and is scheduled to be released on September 10th for the rest of the world through her label Dehisce* which is distributed through The Orchard and Cargo Records. Produced with Grammy nominated writer Dan Burns, Carina collaborated with some notable champions including the legendary Dave Stewart, Brian Eno, and Smashing Pumpkins' front man Billy Corgan. A couple years later, after parting ways with Interscope, Carina toured with Annie Lennox and self-released her ethereal and nakedly confessional EP &lsquo;Things You Should Know', which resulted in considerable success.  Her new songs were featured in numerous film &amp; TV shows and multiple radio stations, including KCRW, championed her music.  Carina became a touring member of Puscifer, Tool's Maynard James Keenan's band, worked on their latest album &lsquo;Conditions of My Parole', and began opening the live shows.Opportunities began to arise to work with other artists Carina admires, including singing on The Twilight Singers album &lsquo;Dynamite Steps', working with the award winning composers John Debney and Glen Ballard on a song composed for the film &lsquo;Valentine's Day', writing with Academy Award winner Marco Beltrami, as well as finishing up an album with her Alt-Country side project Early Winters, which was self-released earlier in the year.

His trademark sugarcane-sweet melodies, pop-soul hooks and rock chords subtly subvert commonly held notions of what Cuban music is. Alex is on the vanguard, crafting a cross-cultural sound that mirrors his geographical journey. Alex is defining his own ""Latin Soul"" genre. He has won two JUNO Awards (2006 and 2008) and a SOCAN Award (2009) in Canada, a Latin Grammy Award (2010) for Best New Artist, a BMI Latin Award and was nominated for a 2011 Grammy Award in the Best Latin Pop Album category. In the digital space, Alex*Cuba has had four iTunes Singles of the Week (Canada, U.S., Japan, Netherlands), has charted on various iTunes charts in Canada, the U.S. and Japan and has independently built an impressive, loyal online community around the world. Alex recently collaborated with Nelly Furtado for her Spanish language debut album ""Mi Plan"" (My Plan) which was released September 2009 around the world (Universal). The creative chemistry between Alex, Nelly and James Bryan was magical and resulted in nine co-writes including the #1 single ""Manos Al Aire"" (Hands in the Air) and the title track where he appears as an invited guest on vocals. A prolific songwriter, Alex is continues working on new collaborations with writers and artists on various projects. In November 2010, Alex was honored with the award for Best New Artist at the 2010 Latin Grammy Awards which took place in Las Vegas. The album ""Alex Cuba"" was also nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Album. Earlier this year, ""Alex Cuba"" was nominated for Best Latin Pop Album at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards and Alex took home a 2011 BMI Latin Award for his songwriting on Nelly Furtado's #1 Spanish hit ""Manos Al Aire"". Critical to Alex' success has been constant touring with a live show that has been described as explosive. Revealing his bass player past, Alex picks, plucks, strums and rocks his Gibson ES355, equipped with the heaviest guage steel strings available, without a pick. <br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.alexcuba.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/alexcuba"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Alex-Cuba/35336990520"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Falex-cuba-band%252Fid82651863%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/123alexcuba"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p><p><strong>TED HOVIS &amp; THE STOLEN CAMAROS</strong><br />Soaring and unrepentant arena rock, deep and dark bass grooves, punctuated with a hint of the blues.

The album features the single ""In Case I Go Again"", which has been placed on popular television shows, including CBS's Ghost Whisperer &amp; MTV's The Real World. In July 2010, the music video for ""In Case I Go Again"" was featured on the YouTube homepage receiving a half-million views. Most recently, the instrumental from this song was featured on NBC during the 2012 Summer Olympics. In the press, the single has been referred to as ""a cool blend of John Mayer meets Coldplay, but clearly still original and catchy!""In April of 2010, Wax released ""The Traveler"" EP for free download on his website mikeywax.com. Integrating social networking to download the EP, ""The Traveler"" received over 10,000 downloads and contributed to Mikey now hosting over 100,000 fans combined via Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and YouTube. In the summer of 2010, Wax completed a headlining house concert tour of 40 homes across the country. This intimate tour left Mikey with hundreds of new fans who connected to his music in a unique and memorable way. ""I knew I was onto something after finishing my very first house show in Boston"", says Wax. ""There's such a special connection made when you play for fans in their own living room. It's up-close and personal."" The success of the 2010 summer tour created even more demand, and resulted in Mikey performing his second annual summer house tour at over 65 homes. While on stage, fans are intrigued by Wax's ability to play both the guitar and piano simultaneously on original songs like ""Last Great Song"" and ""Back and Forth"". Prior to the 2011 summer house tour, Mikey went back to the studio to record his second full-length album with producer Warren Huart (The Fray, Kris Allen, James Blunt). The record, titled ""Constant Motion"", is a dynamic mix that resonates as both a throwback and a fresh, modern sound. The album self-released on September 20th, 2011, and through word-of-mouth, ranked at #6 on the iTunes singer/songwriter chart, and #47 Billboard Heatseekers. The album was supported by a 15-date tour opening for American Idol finalist Elliott Yamin, and features the single ""Counting On You"", which began receiving radio airplay on major adult top-40 stations across the country in December, 2011. ""Counting On You"" continued to build momentum, and on April 9th, 2012, Mikey debuted as only the unsigned artist on the Mediabase adult top-40 (Hot AC) chart. Soon after, Wax was selected by New Music Seminar as an ""artist on the verge"", and supported an east-coast tour with Jon McLaughlin. He was also highlighted by iHeartRadio as an ""Artist To Watch"". On July 25th, ""Counting On You"" was featured on the FOX hit reality television series So You Think You Can Dance. That same night, his song ""You Tell Me When"" was featured on MTV's The Real World. With a distinctive voice, exciting soul-infused pop/rock sound, and passionate live performances, Mikey Wax appears to be on the verge of breakthrough success.<br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""/mikeywax.com"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/mikeywax"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/mikeywax"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fmikey-wax%252Fid295368889%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/mikeywaxmusic"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",17896,$15 ,"5:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens6:30 - Doors7:30 - Graham Colton",10/12/12 23:30The Early November,Cartel,,0,Seahaven,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CARTEL</strong><br />Twenty seconds into ""Let's Go,"" the opening track on CARTEL's third full length CYCLES, singer Will Pugh declares, ""I've got so much left to do but I'll start with this song.""

Dynamic, musically ambitious &amp; bracingly eccentric, with his inimitable style and lush musicality. Hailing from Belfast with a sound that is self-confessed ""hobo-chic"", Duke Special - AKA the endlessly inventive Peter Wilson - is once heard, never forgotten. Blissfully at home in his own alluring genre of beautifully bruised romanticism, Duke Special inhabits a world unlike any other - a world filled with vaudeville-esque sensibility, sing-a-longs and addictive melodies. Those who know him for the platinum album ""Songs from the deep forest"", including the hit song ""Freewheel"" and other radio mainstays like ""Sweet sweet kisses"" and ""Last night I nearly died"" may be surprised by the breadth of his work. Duke Special's immense creative talents have seen him involved in projects as diverse as writing the theme tune for Sesame Tree (the Northern Ireland edition of Sesame Street where he also got to sing with The Muppets) to writing the music for and appearing in Deborah Warner's critically acclaimed 2009 production of Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage and Her Children at London's National Theatre. In 2011, he presented a TV documentary for RTE in Ireland on the life and times of 50s megastar Ruby Murray. This was broadcast in January, and accompanied by 2 orchestral concerts in Dublin and Cork, showcasing Duke's interpretations of Ruby's songs. He also released a charity single of recordings of 3 of Duke's favourite Ruby songs, donating all the profits to the Irish charity Depaul Ireland (www.depaulireland.org). <br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.dukespecial.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official Site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/dukespecial"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Duke-Special/13555697973"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/duke-special/id82412390?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">iTunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/dukespecialofficial"" target=""_blank"">YouTube </a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",17614,$20 ,"6pm - The new Lobby Bar opens7pm - Doors8pm - Bell X1",10/11/12 0:00The Kin + Find Vienna,Struan Shields,,17812,,"<p><strong>STRUAN SHIELDS</strong><br />Singer/songwriterSinger/songwriter Struan Shields hails from Arlington County, Virginia where he's starting to create quite the stir, sharing stage bills with other upcoming talent in the form of pop-rockers Sing Me Insomnia, fellow singer/songwriter Chase Coy, power-poppers The Hint and Shields' good friends; Indie-rock outfit The Downtown Fiction.

The two bands, Shortness Of Breath and Concrete Blues, continue to share the stage and are very supportive of each other's efforts. But now Shortness Of Breath was a three piece band.

Following back to back weekend shows at the Eastside Raw Bar in Winchester, Shortness Of Breath spent the next few months concentrating on recording their debut EP.

Growing up as a shy, middle child of five in an isolated countryside of fields and open air, Matt had little to do but let his imagination run wild.  Perhaps it's that isolation that led him to develop such a prominent voice in his debut album ""Cold Hearted Disaster""--a voice that demands to be heard.  With a natural flair for evoking feeling through his music, this 80's kid, raised on 50's, 60's and 70's soul and rock n roll, found his signature, passionate vocal style through a combination of his upbringing and the aggravation embellished by his heroes of the 90's alt rock scene.

It was time to own it. The thrill of any success and the  weight of any failure would be on my shoulders. I recorded The Fire EP  in August 2008, and the reset process was in full effect. I  self-released 7 more EP's over the course of the next year and a half. I  toured in my car, shared bills with some incredible artists, and made  some new friends. I had a couple of songs placed on Grey's Anatomy and  made it to number 1 on the iTunes singer/songwriter charts a few times.  By May of 2010, I had a list of 30 tunes that I still hadn't recorded.  With the help of fans, Pledge Music, and producer Paul Moak, I had the  team and the resources to make my first full-length album. I headed to  Nashville to make the record I've always wanted to make. Now You're Free  is everything I want it to be. Honest, anthemic and diverse. The songs  are full of hope, which in some ways is very new to me. They are the  sound of a fresh start. I'm excited about attempting to change something  with this record. It could be someone's mood for a few minutes, the  temperature in their room, or the way they watch the sunset driving down  the interstate. Music has changed everything for me. I want to be a  part of that for other people. <br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://matthewmayfield.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/MatthewMayfield"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/matthewmayfieldmusic"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fmatthew-mayfield%252Fid212134615%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/matthewmayfieldmusic"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p><p><strong>CALLAGHAN</strong><br />Born  in Boston, Lincolnshire to a musical family, Callaghan was classically  trained on flute from age 6, then gravitated toward singing and playing  piano. By 14 she was writing songs, and started trekking to London to  record with various producers. At 18 Callaghan relocated to London  permanently to live with her sister (whose flat was so tiny, the singer  slept under the kitchen table), while recording a number of independent  EPs and playing all over the city, at spots like the Bedford, Regal  Room, Royal National Theatre, and 100 Club. A long-time Mullins fan,  Callaghan contacted him in 2009 through MySpace while seeking a  producer, and he agreed to a rare collaboration. An initial recording  trip to Atlanta yielded three songs, prompting her life-changing  relocation there in 2010 to finish the full-length. Since landing  stateside, Callaghan has toured extensively throughout the U.S.,  especially alongside Mullins, and regularly sells out shows in her new  home town of Atlanta. Now that Life In Full Colour is ready for its full  release, further touring is planned in support. This year promises to  pick up right where 2011 left off, but where the singer's compelling  story goes from here is all part of the adventure. For now, Callaghan  will focus on sharing her latest creation with listeners, wherever they  may be.<br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.callaghansongs.com/home.cfm"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/callaghanmusic"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/callaghanmusic"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fcallaghan%252Fid201636659%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/callaghansongs"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p>",16617,$12 ,"5:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens6:30 - Doors7:30 - ShowAfter The Show - Lobby Bar stays open!",9/18/12 23:30@JamnJavaDoorGal's LOCAL SCENE: Sandbox Kings,Tommy Gann Band,,17688,The Understudies,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TOMMY GANN BAND</strong><br />TOMMY GANN is an up-and-coming singer/songwriter who has toured across venues in DC, Northern Virginia, and Maryland over the last several years.

Most powerfully he brings to mind Leonard Cohen, with songwriting which tends to build into powerful, yet vulnerable, cathedral-like monuments of sound. The song ""American,"" with its yearning strings and earnest piano bring chills and a catch in your throat. Magic is Sean Rowe's homage to what he believes in, to what he finds magical in the world. The themes of love, innocence, sex and nature prevail in its heartfelt, crafted songs. On the ambient, deeply resonant closer ""The Long Haul,"" Rowe's voice crackles with life. ""And I never hit the spring so hard/ a newborn song on an old guitar/ and I know what it means to be alive,"" he sings. And like the most evocative, important works of art, Magic begs the question of its listener: What makes you feel alive?<br /><a href=""http://seanrowe.net/default.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/sean_rowe"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/seanrowemusic"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fsean-rowe%252Fid6343625%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://seanrowe.net/page.aspx?id=3.sean-rowe-video"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></p>",16696,$15 advance/ $18 day of,"5:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens6:30 - Doors7:30 - Kris DelmhorstAfter The Show - Lobby Bar stays open!",9/14/12 23:30The Invisible Children Tour: The Rocketboys + Bearcat,Quiet Company,,17717,Andy Zipf,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>QUIET COMPANY</strong><br />In 2011 Quiet Company spent the majority of their time writing &amp; recording their most ambitious &amp; thought provoking album to date, ""We Are All Where We Belong.""

With well over 400 shows played in a little over four years Zipf has held close to a play anywhere for anyone mentality performing at coffee shops, house shows, and the standard venues. Zipf chose out of necessity to go out into the no man's land of touring alone. He held no desire to move to a city cluttered with agents and label relations out of hopes of getting the big record deal. For the D.C. artist music is about the connection it brings and the bond it creates; and the only way to achieve that is to play for anyone at anyplace. From being a PurePick at Purevolume twice, to grabbing the attention of The Today Show, XM Satellite Radio, VH1 and MTV, to now having the song Stumble on the Line featured on the ABC show Private Practice. Zipf has shared the stage with artists like Cold War Kids, Jeremy Enigk, Badly Drawn Boy, Rosie Thomas and Dave Bazan. Each of Zipf &lsquo;s seven releases have carried their own story on how they were made. For his 2009 sophomore album, The Long Tail, Zipf took to playing a series of fundraising concerts, house shows and investor parties, ending with $45,000 donated to produce The Long Tail, a passion stirring release that brought touches of soul to his ever evolving sound. Without a doubt the album's support proves that belief goes a lot father than a social website's play count.<br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.andyzipf.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/andyzipf"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/andy.zipf"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fandy-zipf%252Fid21699918%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/andyzipf"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p>",17718,$10 advance/$13 day of,"5:30 - The new Lobby bar opens6:30 - Doors7:30 - ShowAfter The Show - Lobby Bar stays open!",9/13/12 23:30Dopapod,Former Champions,,0,Moogatu,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FORMER CHAMPIONS</strong><br />Former Champions are an electro rock band based out of Richmond, Virginia.

Having begun at age 11 with classical and flamenco lessons and gradually applying his teachings to the electric and steel string acoustic guitar, Bruno's unique stylings truly have a sound all their own. After stints as a lead guitarist and songwriter for many acclaimed bands (most notably Crowded Streets, a Dave Matthews Band Tribute), Bruno decided it was time to give his fans a bigger taste of his personal musical journey, and thus, Last Second Left was born. Last Second Left's repertoire has been influenced by such notable musicians as Carlos Santana, Baden Powell, Tim Mahoney and Mike Einziger, but it also goes beyond that to truly display Bruno's growth as both a songwriter and guitarist. With guest vocalist Lindsay Hough of The Fishermen and a plethora of other talented backing musicians accompanying Bruno, the final sound demonstrated throughout his self-titled debut album is one of richness and depth. Last Second Left's live shows will also be sure to please, as Bruno is determined to take his fans along with him on his musical voyage, sharing with audiences the energy and passion with which he lives his life - both on stage and off.<br /><a href=""http://lastsecondleft.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a></p><p><strong>ALL THE GODS</strong><br />All The Gods is a melodic guitar-driven power  trio known for live performances of olympic proportions.

In 2009, All  The Gods began tracking a series of demos focused on balancing the  groove, melody, and bombast of their most revered influences. The magic  of those sessions resulted in the self-release of 5 singles, each with  an accompanying video.

The two front-men not only shared common ground creatively but also found they imbedded similar values and messages into their songwriting. Within six months of forming, the group enlisted the producing talents of Greg Parker and Kory Gable as they recorded their first full-length album, ""Wake The City"" (release date: June, 2010). Three months later, their song ""Rockaby in E-Flat"" earned a slot in Hollister Co.'s Fall 2010 worldwide playlist and ""The Drive Home"" was featured on Microsoft's Zune Marketplace. The group's latest splash was a memorable performance at Virgin Mobile FreeFest 2011, which drew a record 50,000 attendees and showcased a multitude of national artists such as Cee Lo Green, The Black Keys, and deadmau5.

Punk had such a passion, and a reckless abandon to it that Simian couldnt stay away. The first time he heard punk rock was when green day played the entire american idiot album on fuse. The aggression of it, yet the melodic back-bone attracted within seconds of first hearing it. He then started exploring punk rock and the rest is history. Andrew grew listening to Ozzy and Metallica records. He loved the energy put into the songs, and the lyrical meaning behind the fast thrash metal sound. Like Simian, Andrew first discovered punk rock when he listened to American Idiot by Green Day in his father's truck when he was 8 years old. However in his music taste, punk was still second to metal. After moving to London and starting a band with Joachim ""THE JOACHIM"" Cedergren, and Chris Saltzgaber, The metal sound became infused with a punk feel, in the group that would be called, Scapegoat. Andrew would bring that Scapegoat sound to the states and form the band you know today as The Oddities.<br /><a href=""http://theoddities.bandcamp.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official Site</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/theodditiesband"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/theodditiesband"" target=""_blank"">YouTube </a></p><p><strong>THE OCCUPANTS</strong><br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/theoccupants"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a></p><p><strong>LIKE YOU TO ME</strong><br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/likeyoutomepoppunk"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a></p>",17744,$10 advance/$13 day of,"4pm - The new Lobby Bar opens5pm - Doors6pm - KeturaAfter The Show - Lobby Bar stays open!",9/2/12 22:00Arteless,GO,,0,,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GO</strong><br />Go has gone through a few line-up changes, which always has an impact on a band's overall sound.

This, included with the band's inclusion on the Maryland date of the 2010 Vans Warped Tour, only foreshadows things to come for The Getaways in the future.<br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.purevolume.com/new/thegetawaysmusic"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/thegetaways"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/thegetaways"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fthe-getaways%252Fid327197771%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> </span></p><p><strong>SANDLOT HEROES</strong><br />Armed with catchy pop/rock songs and talented members, Sandlot Heroes is committed to a new kind of sound.

With miles behind and miles ahead, life in a van will change a band; and All Get Out are no exception. From the wasted days stranded, to the desolate moments of doubt, to the nights where immortality stretches through bended notes, two-hundred and fifty shows a year has shaped the band known for their attitude and angst on display through high woven volume into a refined framework fusing gambled moments and glossy catchiness. Just as All Get Out accidentally ended up spending the formidable part of their &lsquo;20s counting mile markers, so did The Season unintentionally transform itself into a pop record when the band began tracking with producer Matt Malpass (Lydia, Copeland). Still visceral and soul-bearing as before, The Season stretches All Get Out into the frequencies beyond reactionary abrasions. Songs like My Friends, Son of Mine, Don't Let Me Go and Girl Gun display an innocence, but the rest of the album shows a band aware that the horizon holds more than can be comprehended.<br /><a href=""http://www.loudasallgetout.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/jrastronomers"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/allgetout"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fall-get-out%252Fid280227264%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/Gordonkeiter"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></p><p><strong>HARRISON HUDSON</strong><br />The American rock n' roll of the &lsquo;50s and &lsquo;60s ran on raw, unfiltered emotion, and was driven by ardent soul. The muscle cars, steel mechanics, and never ending highways were the image, but the spirit was inherit in the far reaching melodies and layered vocals - the ideal at the heart of American Thunder, Harrison Hudson's third full-length album. Behind the languishing spacious guitars and the overall smooth vibe there is Hudson himself, sharing the best moments of the American rock radio that lavished his childhood. Formed in 2005 in Atlanta, GA Harrison Hudson began as a songwriter backed by a band. In 2006 his debut Angel On One Side...And the Other On The Other displayed a dark shade, a monument of Hudson's life at the time, but by 2008 Harrison Hudson had become a full band, a trio that found a new home in Nashville, TN releasing the no-frills, full volume, Blood, Sweat, and Sweat. As soon as recording was finished Hudson began writing again, 70 songs that would be sliced down to an integral 12 of pop hooks and rock twist free of overbearing romantic gestures, the shape of American Thunder. The spirit of the old days of Rock N' Roll radio have been captured and embraced, not re-manufactured.<br /><a href=""http://harrisonhudson.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/harrisonhudson"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/harrisonhudson?ref=ts"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fharrison-hudson%252Fid257055066%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/strikeonboxphoto/videos"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></p><p><strong>DEATH ON TWO WHEELS</strong><br />Death On Two Wheels makes rock 'n' roll dangerous again, with slurry-blurry lyrics, half-cocked dreamspeak of portents and regret, and a formidable guitar attack that recalls the nasty duels Allen Collins waged with Gary Rossington before Skynyrd's final plane ride. Following the same bumpy trail as Kings of Leon, this Atlanta foursome seems to be in pursuit of darker mysteries on the band's self-released debut. And unlike the Kings, they have more range and a greater reverence for '70s classic rock, not to mention the eccentric bite of vocalist Trae Vedder. Could he really have been christened with such a propitious rock name? No matter, he has the same grit and red clay in his voice that Chris Robinson had before he got famous and complacent-but there's something even more disturbing in Vedder's delivery that almost veers into goth. Especially on a song like ""Bobby Havis,"" which shudders with psychedelic anxiety. It's a song so haunting it could've been penned in Rose Hill Cemetery next to Duane Allman's headstone.<br /><a href=""http://deathontwowheels.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/do2w"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/deathontwowheels"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fdeath-on-two-wheels%252Fid293763869%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/deathontwowheels1"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></p><p><strong>JUNIOR ASTRONOMERS</strong><br />Junior Astronomers. A consistency in disorder breathes into existence a quintet bound to the loud and impulsive. Gritty and jangled on some occasions, then mangled and diverting in others. The only thing planned is the outburst itself. A hypnotic trance is created through guitars painted heavy and a rhythm section bound for movement, but beneath the distortions and muddled screams Junior Astronomers seek to achieve more than just reactions from onlookers; the band itself tries to document the human experience. On stage the mess of humanity is embraced through a livid live show-devoid of controlled manipulation each night's set stumbles onto new devices. Passion bleeds over lofty construction making sure the songs themselves are the frame. The rest is unhinged and never over thought. Continually on the move since forming in 2007, with only two EPs to their name, Junior Astronomers have toured and shared stages with the likes of Harvard, The Weeks, Dignan, Color Revolt, Des Ark, and Polvo.

After months of scouring local musician ads he came across an ad guitarist Jim Connolly posted. Listing influences like the Replacements, The Clash and The Hold Steady, the ad seemed too good to be true. Jim, a veteran of the local DC scene (The Highballers, 69 A Go-Go), and Adam hit it off instantly. Sharing drinks at a local dive, they quickly bonded over their shared love of the many great power pop, indie, and rock and roll bands of the past 40 years. After a few false, they quickly roped in the rock solid rhythm section of drummer Ahmad Asi and bassist Soren Bakken (Helo) and dug in hard. Christened the 27's (after the countless music legends that have left us at that age) the four had an easy camaraderie and the original tunes came pouring out. Determined to capture the energy while still fresh, they opted to enter the studio before even playing a gig. Working with noted producer Don Zientara at Inner Ear studios, the 27's recorded 5 songs in the summer of 2011 that showcase their knack for catchy hooks and loud guitars. Finally, 2012 will see the live debut of the 27s as they seek to make their mark on the DC music scene.<br /><a href=""http://www.reverbnation.com/the27sdc"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a></p><p><strong>THREESOUND</strong><br />Formed in the small town of Winchester, Virginia in 2009, Threesound embodies a musical passion that thrives in all music followers.

But at 15, the aspiring singer tried her hand at a local open mic -- and her attempt was receivedwith praise.""I'm downstairs running the club, selling beer, and she's sound-checking, and instantly I was blown away,"" says her manager, Daniel Brindley, who owns the suburban-D.C. music club Jammin Java. Brindley began inviting Lee to open for his acts, and in a few months she was headlining shows. Armed with an alarmingly pure voice, down-to-earth charm, and a songwriting maturity that's rare for her age, Lee appears to have the entire package. In 2008 she got the attention of Atlantic Records, and in June she signed with the label just days after her 18th birthday.With less than three years between her first open mic and her record deal, Lee's ascent is remarkable, especially given how quickly she's taken to performing. ""I was really nervous at first"" she says, but as an audience member you'd never know it. A gorgeous girl with organic songs is bound to draw comparisons to Taylor Swift and Colbie Caillat, but Lee's voice carries an emotional depth that's more like Patty Griffin or Brandi Carlile. ""A lot of people ask me, 'who do you sound like?"" she laughs, ""but I never have an answer for them.""For a while, the only place Chelsea Lee was comfortable singing was in the shower. But at 15, the aspiring singer tried her hand at a local open mic -- and her attempt was received with praise. Though she's well-known in her native D.C., in February a pair of synchs on MTV's ""The City"" for her songs ""Figure Us Out"" and ""Long Way Down"" provided some deserved national exposure. Around that time she spent three weeks in London writing with Martin Terefe, producer of Jason Mraz's platinum-selling ""We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things."" Currently she's working out of Charlottesville, Virginia, with writer/producer Chris Keup (Parachute, O.A.R., Josh Kelley).<br /> <span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.chelsealeemusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/chelsealeemusic"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://facebook.com/chelsealeemusic"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fchelsea-lee%252Fid475905482%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/chelsealeemusic"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",17407,$15 ,"6pm - The new Lobby Bar opens7pm - Doors8pm - David Ryan HarrisAfter The Show - Lobby Bar stays open!",8/22/12 0:00Future,The Memorials (featuring Thomas Pridgen formerly of The Mars Volta),,0,Mission Bells,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>THE MEMORIALS (featuring Thomas Pridgen formerly of The Mars Volta)</strong><br />The Memorials were spearheaded by Bay Area drumming prodigy, Thomas Pridgen, in December of 2009. After a few years performing with The Mars Volta, Thomas turned his attention to forming his own group, incorporating a range of styles as diverse as the experiences of the bands members. Instead of becoming another rock bands' heartbeat, the focus was to collaborate with proficient musicians. The passion and intensity of the recording sessions is audible on The Memorials debut effort, as they combine a vast array of sounds atop Thomas and Nick's compositions. Nick's sprawling guitars and Thomas' thick drums serve as the core of the sound, while Viveca's voice brings it together perfectly. The end music is intelligent and calculated, exhibiting certain pop sensibilities within the scope of songs that rock out. The compositions highlight each musician's incredible talent, while creating textured tracks that feel like vignettes of a band finding their stride.<br /><a href=""http://www.thememorialsmusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/TheMemorials"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/thememorials"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fthe-memorials%252Fid406234085%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/thememorialsmusic"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></p><p><strong>MISSION BELLS</strong><br />The Mission Bells is a San Francisco band whose debut album, ""the Carbon Circus,"" will be released in 2012.

But that's exactly what California-bred, Austin-based Amy Cook has been doing for more than a decade - winning over fans with tunes that not only connect, but also attach themselves to the very heart of pleasure. Working in Los Angeles helped her gain the sort of visibility that landed her songs in such TV shows as Dawson's Creek, Veronica Mars, Laguna Beach and The L Word.  Restless, in 2005, she loaded up the truck and moved to Texas. In the process, she managed to reconcile those two seemingly disparate settings - the home of the sunny pop hook and the hardscrabble back roads that spawn rough hewn roots rock - and to craft a sound that's all her own. The elements of rock and pop and folk, along with a goodly dose of ether, found their way into both The Sky Observer's Guide and the homemade Bunkhouse Recordings - which Michael Corcoran described by saying ""The big sky of stars and fireflies is made for music like this.""

While they may be placed into the jam band box, they are far from your average jam band. You will not see or hear this band attempting to copy or recreate the style or sound of another group. These guys don't try to be cool, because they don't need to. They seem perfectly content being themselves and they don't try to hide this, even on stage.

In 2005, the remastered rerelease of ""Thinks of Her"" gained Davis national exposure and brought him to the attention of legendary music producer Mitchell Froom (Paul McCartney, Sheryl Crow, Elvis Costello). The result of their collaboration was ""Let the Woman,"" a sophisticated, sonically adventurous album that ignited a bidding war. Barnes and Noble won the exclusive rights to distribute ""Let the Woman"" online and in their stores all over the world. The album's single, ""Brown Eyes,"" became a staple on AAA radio stations nationwide, and ""Let the Woman"" became a #4 bestseller. In 2009, Davis returned to Nashville to record his latest EP, ""New History,"" which was featured in -- and inspired -- a recent episode of ABC's ""Grey's Anatomy.""

He formed the trio ""Grasping at Straws"" at Georgetown University with Emile Doak on Bass and Matt Galizia on Drums. After playing together for a semester and performing on campus, the band went on haitus while Matt and Anatole went abroad. When the band came back together in 2011, they added Joe Albanese on guitar until the band disbanded in the summer of 2012. During the spring of 2012 Anatole started another project with the incredibly talented group of Matt Galizia on drums, Chris Harold on guitar and Charlie Burgoyne on bass which included a performance at the 9:30 Club as a part of a battle of the bands competition, and recording the ""Grasping at Straws"" EP at Bias Studios in Springfield, VA.

Playing over 500 shows internationally, having a charted single on FMBQ, multiple appearances at SXSW and CMJ, winning national contests and, most importantly, building a musical relationship with the members of the band. Everything culminated at CMJ In October 2011 when top audio engineer, Ari Raskin (Robin Thicke, One Republic, Justin Timberlake, Kanye West), came to one of Jay's shows at Rockwood Music Hall. Jay's band that night was comprised mostly of former members of Julius C, and the chemistry impressed Raskin. He immediately offered to record the band at Downtown Records Studio in NYC, which led to the recording of a 4-track EP to be released in Spring 2012.

Produced by former My Favorite Highway lead singer, Dave Cook, each song is colored by delightful hooks and a wash of uncertainty, leaving listeners transfixed by Graham's unforgettable blanket of a voice. A Northern Virginia native, the 25-year-old songstress grew up singing in school choir and playing her acoustic guitar in local coffee bars. She picked up piano through a year of music classes in college. As the former lead singer of the band Noble Air, Graham was featured on the premiere webisode of Aux Send, which landed in the Top 10 of New &amp; Noteworthy Artists on iTunes in 2011.<br /><a href=""http://eileengrahammusic.com"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/Eileen_Graham"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.new.facebook.com/eileengrahammusic?sk=app_2405167945"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Feileen-graham%252Fid538665927%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/eileengrahammusic"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></p>",17613,$15 GA / $25 VIP - M&G,"5:00 - The new Lobby Bar opens5:45 - Doors - M&G7:00 - Doors - GA8:00 - Alexz Johnson:Skipping Stone Tour",8/2/12 0:00@JamnJavaDoorGal's LOCAL SCENE: Sub-Radio Standard,Nor Cator & The Ooh La La's,Chloe Angelides,0,Laurel Ridge,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SUB-RADIO STANDARD</strong><br />Sub-Radio Standard originated with Matt and John messing around with covers and attempting original songs in Matt's basement in 2005. By the end of 2008 however, with the addition of drummer, Michael, the band began to concentrate on producing original lyrics and melodies. After auditioning several singers without luck, the band finally found Adam. The new dynamics of the group helped to jumpstart the band's productivity and Sub-Radio Standard was officially born. Later, Mark Barry Siford joined on bass and Mike Chinen joined on guitar to smooth up the rhythm section. The band quickly began writing original songs as well as learning covers. They have successfully recorded a thirteen song album and have many more songs in the making. Sub-Radio Standard loves to perform at any venue and are eager to share their music with even larger audiences. In 2010 they opened for nationally touring act Ian Axel. Early in 2012 they played the DC Rock N' Roll Marathon, which was headlined by Switchfoot.<br /><a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/subradiostandrd"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sub-Radio-Standard/101931085265"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a></p><p><strong>NOR CATOR &amp; THE OOH LA LA'S</strong><br />Nor Cator &amp; The Ooh La La's is a rock band from Northern Virginia that began in the fall of 2010 created by vocalist Ryan Morris and guitarist Ryan Nethercutt who were later joined by live performers Ryan Cunningham on drums and Josh Murphy on bass.

Classically trained from an early age, the Atlanta-based quartet -- Kathryn, Annika, Fiona and Petra von Grey -- have built on that foundation by performing upwards of 200 shows in the past two years, from recurring residency tours at intimate venues throughout the southeastern U.S. to supporting gigs with such artists as Sarah McLachlan. Working in a vein similar to that of such contemporaries as The Civil Wars and Mumford &amp; Sons, von Grey masterfully melds folk, bluegrass and country influences, imbuing time-honored musical idioms with a distinctly modern sensibility. From the opening ""What Am I,"" a stirring plea for unity and understanding, to the bittersweet ""Shane,"" the collection provides a remarkable introduction to von Grey. indeed, it's their attunement to this rhythm that makes von Grey's songs at once so personal and so universal.

Prior to his arrival in the Mid-Atlantic region, the  Everything Falls frontman completed his degree in Recording Industry and  learned the ropes at two fast-paced Nashville recording studios. It was  there in Music City, that he honed his skills as a singer/songwriter.In  2010, Linkous relocated to the DC-MD-VA area where he soon met current  bassist, Mike Smith. Together, Smith and Linkous began a diligent search  for additional musicians. After multiple rounds of auditions in 2011,  the duo gladly welcomed Jeff Sauber on drums and Gabe Goodin on lead  guitar. Everything Falls was finally formed. Influenced by (1) the  intricate, powerful riffs of such bands as Breaking Benjamin, Chevelle,  Three Days Grace and Metallica, and (2) the lyrical sentiments of bands  like 3 Doors Down and Theory of a Deadman, Everything Falls delivers a  hard-hitting combination of dynamic melodies and gripping lyrics.

Burnham  has crafted a debut album filled with catchy rock/pop anthems.Their  Island Def Jam debut album represents their first time co-writing with  such established producers as OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder, Brian Kennedy  (Chris Brown, Rihanna, Backstreet Boys, Jesse McCartney), the N.Y.-based  Norwegian production team Espionage of Espen Lind and Amund Bjorklund  (Train's ""Hey, Soul Sister"" and Beyonce's ""Irreplaceable""), Andy Marvel  (Jessica Simpson, Celine Dion)/ Freddy Shehadi of Headspinners, and  James Bourne of Busted (""Year 3000""). With their good-natured sibling  rivalry, each of the three Burnhams bring something a little different  to the table. Alex is the designated riff-meister and Forrest is great  at finding melodies, while Andre, also known as M.D.(music director),  organizes the rehearsals and comes up with lyrical ideas.

Adding full-band accompaniment to his lush, soulful pop-rock, Ruben also stretches impressively as a writer on The Ones That Matter, achieving a near-novelistic sense of character and setting on finely hewn tracks like ""A Lack of Armor,"" ""Bleeker and Sixth,"" and ""Unbreakable."" His relentless attention to detail pays off handsomely. Ruben's expansive and deeply compassionate point of view has resonated strongly with an ever-growing audience, whom the performer has cultivated with virtually nonstop touring and persistent online networking; as a result, he's sold some 5,000 copies of Honesty on his own. The artist cites singer-songwriters like Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell and James Taylor as his greatest influences, but also admits a fondness for the standards penned by Cole Porter and the Gershwins. As a live performer he racked up odd experiences like playing backyard barbecues, singing at a daytime Sweet 16 party, and even serenading a couple of fans on their anniversary (he showed up in their kitchen with his guitar, at the woman's bidding, to surprise her boyfriend). The gigs gradually got bigger, and soon Ruben was paying his rent with engagements across the East Coast - becoming adept at getting around by commuter rail, booking cheap flights, promoting his shows and maintaining contact with fans via Facebook, his blog and the comments on his YouTube video posts.<br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://jesseruben.com/jesseruben/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/jesseruben"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/jesserubenmusic"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fjesse-ruben%252Fid269249439%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/jesserubenmusic"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p><p><strong>SARAH MILES</strong><br />Singer-songwriter, Sarah Miles is a young woman with a killer voice, catchy pop melodies, some fabulous high heels, and a hint of twang.

The band took a new direction with their sound and began to create a more ""pop punk"" sound with a touch of soul in the background.

Combining rock, strong melodic vocals, classical piano with hard techno-centric beats, and wailing heavy guitar riffs, this up-and-coming trio has hit a major stride. Influences as wide as Rachmanninoff to Radiohead, Smashing Pumpkins to Muse, Rage Against the Machine to Mute Math can be heard in their music. Lead vocalist and guitarist/keyboardist, Sean Mahon, started this as a solo project; producing and recording his original music in his home studio until he crossed paths with bassist/guitarist, JFork (from Cobbler, The War Within, and Pebble to Pearl), and with drummer, Justin LaMora (formerly of Chained Down). After making their official debut just a mere month ago, Fallworth battled it out in this year's KollaborationDC competition to an audience of 700 plus, and took home 3rd place. They are already creating quite a buzz and steadily increasing their fan-base beyond the DC area. Fallworth will soon be going into the studio in hopes of releasing their first EP later this year.<br /><span style=""color: #808080;""><a href=""http://www.fallworth.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/fallworthmusic"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/fallworthmusic"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/officialFallworth"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p><p><span style=""color: #ffffff;""><strong>CALL FOR FIRE</strong></span><br />Taking the immense musical creativity of the 70's and pairing it with smashing alternative riffs, Call for Fire brings back the genuine hard rock sound while also drawing from inventive melodies to provide listeners an original experience. <br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Callforfireband"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a></p><p><span style=""color: #ffffff;""><strong>THEYCALLMEPIANO</strong></span><br />Born in 1997, Piano is an emerging singer-songwriter with influences that span from rock to techno. Piano has written hundreds of songs but she hasn't tied herself to any specific genre of music. She writes in a style of her own that best suits her vision of a song, which is normally evoked by personal experiences. Piano's musical journey began at age three when she taught herself to play the keyboard and was immediately driven to make up her own songs. A song written for her graduating class is still being played today as students leave on the last day of school. At age ten, a collaboration with KidzBob resulted in an original series called ""Rockin' it Old School"" where in each episode she would give a short history of a Classic Rock Band and then perform one of their songs. It was in Elementary School that her friends started calling her ""Piano"" and the nickname stuck.<br /><span style=""color: #808080;""><a href=""http://www.theycallmepiano.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/Theycallmepiano"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Theycallmepiano/301402276569929"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/theycallmepiano"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p><p><span style=""color: #ffffff;""><strong>MATT PORTER</strong></span><br />""Fusing elements of singer-songwriting to shoegaze pop, there's some incredible song under this young man's belt.

His first serious instrument was the Trumpet which was introduced to him by his parents in 2001. He participated in his elementary, middle, and high school concert and marching bands with the trumpet. In 2009 he had written over 100 songs. Since he had all these songs and no music to go along with them he got a keyboard for his birthday that spring. He then taught himself the basics on piano and the chords needed to build the melodies for his songs. His interest for writing and putting together songs increased and that summer he got his first guitar. He also taught himself guitar and then singing came into play. During the fall of 2009 he formed a rock band called ""The Remedy"" with two of his friends from high school. These performances helped build his confidence at In the summer of 2010 he put his music up online for the first time as a solo act. Earlier that year he actually started to write songs that were in a different style than his band.To this day he still puts up videos and songs for his fans and other people to see. He has now thousands of ""Likes"" on Facebook, thousands of views on YouTube, and an international fan base with fans from the United States, Brazil, Indonesia, Australia, England, France, India, Portugal, and many more countries.<br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/eddyfaulknermusic"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Feddy-faulkner%252Fid381624481%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/eddyftw2"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></p>",16818,$10 advance/$13 day of,"4:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens5:30 - Doors6:30 - ShowAfter The Show - Lobby Bar stays open!",6/19/12 22:30Eric Lindell (at The Hamilton),,,0,,,15825,$27.50 ,,6/17/12 23:30"Dave Nachmanoff  ""Step Up"" CD Release Party",Tiffany Thompson,,0,,"<p><strong><span style=""color: #ffffff;"">TIFFANY THOMPSON</span></strong><br />""The Washington D.C. / Northern Virginia area is known for its fast-paced, transient lifestyle and cacophonous atmosphere, but singer-songwriter Tiffany Thompson is imparting something quieter, more personal, and lasting to its character.

Traveling the miles along a star-kissed path, the first break came early for D.C.'s ska darlings, when they landed a 1992 tour opening for ska originals, Bad Manners. In 1997, Rancid's Tim Armstrong signed them to Hellcat/Epitaph where they recorded two albums with producer Brett Gurewitz (Bad Religion): the genre-defining Willis (SPIN Magazine called it ""An equal opportunity dancehall crasher - part &lsquo;60s keg rock, part 2Tone and part Motown"") and Awesome Mix Tape #6 (CMJ noted it for ""lacing a Stax shout-out feel with Caribbean rhythms""). The soul-charged Turbo was released in 2002 by Fueled by Ramen. The Pietasters shared bills with NOFX and Less Than Jake on the epic '98 and '99 Warped Tours, and followed with a stateside run with punk legend Joe Strummer Three years later, they worked as James Brown's back-up band for one surreal evening (All Day was produced by James Brown's engineer, Todd Harris). Not bad for a bunch of guys who started out as a teenaged underground band from D.C. The Pietasters have been served well by the signs they've encountered along the road during their 17 years as a band. As the sun comes up on All Day, the experience and commitment that defines The Pietasters as an entity should find friends among the faithful as well as to first-timers to the ska-soul sound.<br /><span style=""color: #808080;""><a href=""http://www.thepietasters.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Pietasters"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> </span></p>",16767,$20 ,"6:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens 7:30 - Doors8:30 - ShowAfter The Show - Lobby Bar stays open!",6/16/12 0:30Sonia (from Disappear Fear) + Rachael Sage,,,16331,,,16332,$15 ,"6pm - The new Lobby Bar opens7pm - Doors8pm - ShowAfter The Show - Lobby Bar stays open!",6/14/12 0:00In The Lobby: Carry The One,,,0,,,16682,FREE!,"7pm - The new Lobby Bar opens8pm - The FREE Lobby Bar show",6/13/12 0:00Gary Jules CD Release,,,0,,,16358,$15 ,"6pm - The new Lobby Bar opens7pm - Doors8pm - Show",6/12/12 0:00Private Event,,,0,,,16645,,,6/9/12 23:00Private Event,,,0,,,13700,,,6/9/12 23:00McLean High School & Longfellow Middle School Big Band Jam,,,0,,,14903,$10 ,"11:30am - The new Lobby Bar opens12:30pm - Doors1:30pm - McLean High School & Longfellow Middle School Big Band Jam",6/9/12 17:30"SNRG FIREDAY 8 ""SEE no evil, HEAR no evil, SPEAK""",Connie Lim,,0,Jenn Bostic ,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style=""color: #ffffff;"">CONNIE LIM</span></strong><br />Connie Lim has coined her music as ""retrotronica"": music that exudes modern electronic textures alongside nostalgic songwriting.

""These guys can play,"" notes Barber, ""that's what made the sessions really rewarding."" Beyond the quartet's growth as musicians, the theme of 'shifting' appears in the underlying emphasis on change in the songs, Eicher's evolution as a songwriter, and the band's ability to shift seamlessly between various styles, giving the album a ""mainstream likability that is both charming and contagious,"" praises the Herald-Standard.</span><br /><span style=""color: #808080;""><a href=""http://www.jdeicherandthegoodnights.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/jdeicher"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/jdeicherandthegoodnights"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fjd-eicher-the-goodnights%252Fid334062128%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/jdeicher"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></span><br /></span></p>",16090,$12 ,"4:00 - The new Lobby Bar opens5:00 - Doors6:00 - Show",6/8/12 22:00Alvin Youngblood Hart��_��__��_s Muscle Theory,,,0,,,16624,$15 ,"6pm - The new Lobby Bar opens7pm - Doors8pm - Alvin Youngblood Hart��_��__��_s Muscle Theory ",6/8/12 0:00"TRACE BUNDY ""Elephant King"" CD RELEASE",,,0,,,15259,$15 advance/ $18 day of,"5:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens6:30 - Doors7:30 - Trace Bundy",6/5/12 23:30Rhett Miller & the Serial Lady Killers,The Spring Standards,,0,,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style=""color: #ffffff;"">THE SPRING STANDARDS</span></strong><br /><span style=""color: #ffffff;"">The Spring Standards (formerly Old Springs Pike) are an energetic force of three-part harmony from New York City circling over a rock n' roll sound with an old country aftertaste.

They created a music myspace under the name ""Bethany and the Guitar,"" and it stuck. Because Kurtis lived in Nashville, TN and Bethany in Blacksburg, VA, the siblings would co-write by sending short video clips of a melodies or guitar riffs and built off of each other's ideas. They recorded wherever they could-guest bedrooms, dorms, and even a summer camp. These songs made up Bethany's first release, a self-titled EP that debuted February 2010. The band turned into more than a hobby when Bethany decided to leave college and move to Arlington, VA where Kurtis and his wife, Sarah, now reside. They have been playing shows around Northern Virginia and Washington, DC as often as possible.

His style is completely diverse, to the point that you will not be able to expect what he will come out with next. He gained this diversity from his love of many different genres of music. Moving on, C Dot was always subjected to music and he always had a knack for words. Writing short stories about whatever his imagination cooked up, and being the lady lover that he was, poems to try to win over the hearts of any chick that he had a crush on. Eventually his love for poetry got transferred into rapping. Other kids at the school used to freestyle before class and at lunch and C Dot would attempt to join them. Usually being humiliated and ridiculed with statements such as (""You can't rap."" or ""Are you even black?"") From then on C Dot decided to try even harder to prove himself to his peers. Later on down the road he met Logic, who saw the talent that Castro possessed and took him under his wing.

He discovered at the age of 10 an insatiable love for music, and devoted the majority of his pre-teen years to musical discovery and creation. Josiah is most notably known for a brief tenure on season 7 of the television show ""American Idol"", on which he made a name for himself performing original songs and accompanying himself on piano. Warner Brothers Records executives signed him a month after the airing of the show. Josiah spent 3 tumultuous years on WBR, releasing two EPs titled ""Angels Undercover EP"" and ""Punk Ass Rain EP"" and finally in the fall of 2010 released his debut album ""Come on Kid"" behind a weak label promotional effort. He dropped from the label's roster at the end of the promotional tour for the record. In the coming weeks, he released his management, booking agent, business management, and publicist. He gathered his unrecorded songs and an arsenal of new songs and began to envision a new record, the record he always wanted to make. He called upon his favorite musicians, mostly personal friends, to be a part of the creation of a record free of corporate sway. After a summer of hours turned to days and weeks on end in the studio, he has now appeared with his sophomore album ""Another Life"". The first single off the new record, ""One Last Song"" - one of Josiah's most revered tunes - wasted no time in breaking into the iTunes top 100 charts. His second single, ""Too Young"", is already getting airplay in local and college markets. Josiah Leming has risen and fallen, and risen and fallen, and he is certainly rising again.<br /><span style=""color: #808080;""><a href=""http://josiahleming.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/josiahleming"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/JosiahLeming"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fjosiah-leming%252Fid293889695%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/ohjaimes78"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p><p><strong><span style=""color: #ffffff;"">JESSE RUBEN</span></strong><br />23-year-old, Philly-bred singer-songwriter Jesse Ruben freely confides that he's done a bit of ""obsessing"" over his second album, The Ones That Matter. Ruben's expansive and deeply compassionate point of view has resonated strongly with an ever-growing audience, whom the performer has cultivated with virtually nonstop touring and persistent online networking; as a result, he's sold some 5,000 copies of Honesty on his own.  The online community also came in handy when he was recording his debut album. ""I had no money, and five of my friends held a Facebook fundraiser for me,"" he reports. ""They presented me with a giant check for $2,500 on my twenty-first birthday."" And though elements of this initial effort seem distant to him now, Ruben credits Honesty with giving him a leg up in building his audience; in addition to the brisk sales of his debut, he continues to enjoy rapturous fan feedback about its songs.<br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://jesseruben.com/jesseruben/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/home?status=Jesse%20Ruben+-+http://jesseruben.com/jesseruben+"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://jesseruben.com/jesseruben&amp;t=Jesse%20Ruben"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fjesse-ruben%252Fid269249439%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://jesseruben.com/jesseruben/videos"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span><span style=""color: #888888;""><span style=""color: #808080;""></span></span><span style=""color: #ffffff;""></span></p><p><strong><span style=""color: #ffffff;"">AMY LENNARD</span></strong><br /><span style=""color: #808080;""><a href=""http://www.amylennard.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/amylennard"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/amylennardmusic"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Famy-lennard%252Fid317511981%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",15528,$10adv / $13 day of,"5:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens6:30 - Doors7:30 - Amy Lennard8:00 - Jesse Ruben8:30 - Josiah Leming9:00 - Ron Pope",4/24/12 23:30Bowling For Soup,Patent  Pending,Sandlot Heroes,0,Freshman 15,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /><strong><span style=""color: #ffffff;"">PATENT PENDING</span></strong><br /><span style=""color: #808080;""><a href=""http://www.patentpendingmusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.patentpendingmusic.com/twitter"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.patentpendingmusic.com/facebook"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fpatent-pending%252Fid157842832%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes </a>| <a href=""http://youtu.be/oQkOhQjcW4Y"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p><p><br /><span style=""color: #ffffff;""><strong>FRESHMAN 15</strong></span><br />It's time to start feeling really good, as Freshman 15 return with their brand new album ""Here's To Feeling Good"" on March 13th, 2012.

The songwriting, performances and production are so addictive that I'm not willing to give Pacific Coast Eyes up for quite a while."" - Michael Ragogna, Huffington Post<br /><span style=""color: #808080;""><a href=""http://grahamcolton.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/grahamcolton"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/grahamcolton"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fgraham-colton%252Fid49280333%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/GrahamColton"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p>",15664,$12 advance/$15 day of,"6:00 - The new Lobby Bar opens7:00 - Doors8:00 - Graham Colton9:15 - Green River Ordinance",4/20/12 0:00Lovedrug,Last Royals ,,0,Andy Zipf (full band),"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br /><span style=""color: #ffffff;"">THE LAST ROYALS</span></strong><br />The Last Royals, a duo of writer/singer/producer Eric James and drummer Mason Ingram, are nascent, having only recently emerged from a joint project that brought the two musicians together in Spring 2010. The connection urged a new chapter in Eric's career as a musician, evolving him from a solo artist who played under the moniker The Early Hours to one-half of a self-proclaimed pop band. The Last Royals collect the discarded remnants of a day in the city and glue them back together to reveal a new picture, making music from the broken pieces. The songs are necessary responses to the difficulties life presents. The sound of the music is hopeful and bright, but the juxtaposition of words and sounds evoke a candid depth that accurately echoes our lives. In the end the conflation of all the pieces harkens back to the moment of its creation. The most beautiful moment of any song is the moment it was written and it's that instant that lingers in each note of The Last Royals' music.<br /><span style=""color: #808080;""><a href=""http://thelastroyals.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/TheLastRoyals"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/thelastroyals"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fthe-last-royals%252Fid404835154%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/thelastroyals"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p><p><span style=""color: #ffffff;""><strong>ANDY ZIPF</strong></span><br />Andy Zipf (pronounced ZIFF) has stretched well beyond feverous guitar playing and dug deeper into his coined intimate falsetto voice on his third full length, Jealous Hands.

After months of scouring local musician ads he came across an ad guitarist Jim Connolly posted. Listing influences like the Replacements, The Clash and The Hold Steady, the ad seemed too good to be true. Jim, a veteran of the local DC scene (The Highballers, 69 A Go-Go), and Adam hit it off instantly. Sharing drinks at a local dive, they quickly bonded over their shared love of the many great power pop, indie, and rock and roll bands of the past 40 years. Working with noted producer Don Zientara at Inner Ear studios, the 27's recorded 5 songs in the summer of 2011 that showcase their knack for catchy hooks and loud guitars. Finally, 2012 will see the live debut of the 27s as they seek to make their mark on the DC music scene.<br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-27s/221110081269562"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",15392,$12 ,"6pm - The new Lobby Bar opens7pm - Doors8pm - The 27S9pm - Trapper Schoepp & The Shades10pm - Tommy Stinson",4/14/12 0:00VOUS ��_��___TES DES ANIMAUX - EDM!,,,0,,"<p>Performers Include:</p><p>Bassdread  <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Bassdread"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/Bassdread</a><br />DJ Throdown <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Bassdread"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/djthrodown</a><br />Dj 0bscure <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Dj0bscure"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/Dj0bscure</a><br />Digital Eyes  <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/digitaleyesofficial"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/digitaleyesofficial</a><br />Jeremy P <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/digitaleyesofficial"" target=""_blank"">http://www.wix.com/jtpayne/djjeremyp2</a><br />DJ Bliss &amp; DJ Robo</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",15366,$10 ,"5pm - The new Lobby Bar opens6pm - Doors",4/12/12 23:00Tyler Hilton,Dion Roy,,0,Dakota & Will,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""color: #ffffff;""><strong>DION ROY</strong></span><br />Dion Roy is a singer-songwriter known for fusing his bass-inspired roots with his knack for writing an unforgettable pop/rock hook.

He is a   songsterbased in Philadelphia, PA. As part of the music community in his   city, Kasper is regarded as a favorite by radio and fellow  songwriters.  A subtle showman, his songs, records and shows lift from  the ground and  surround. He has received some national critical acclaim  from outlets  such as iTunes, Ragged Magazine, ABC  and has opened for  Amos Lee, The  Wood Brothers, and G. Love among others. Most recent news  includes the  completion of his latest recording ""The First Hundred  Years Are The  Hardest"" (2011) produced by friend and peer Andrew Lipke.  This  collaboration has pushed Kasper's signature sound into further  corners  of the singer/ songwriter label and opened new possible  directions for  future efforts. While ""Chasing Another Sundown"" (2009)  proved to be a  meticulous production (Jeff Hiatt) with the thread of  sweeping pedal  steel by Adam Davis, The ""First Hundred..."" is sonically  more electric  and stylistically more varied. Like ""FlyingBoy"" (2006),  most of the  instruments were played by Chris and Andrew with the  occasional help of  some key guest players including Fred Berman (Amos  Lee) and Chris  Giraldi (Rachel Yamagata).

They released two albums in February of 2007 called Lunatic Frame and Pixie Junk (a collection of b-sides). Both were self-produced and released on the bands own label, T!LT Records. Only a few hundred copies were made, hand numbered and personalized by the band members themselves. Both discs were made available at local record shops in the D.C. area. 2009 saw the worldwide re-release of Lunatic Frame in digital format. In Summer of 2011, the band started work on a new album called Advantage (co-produced and mixed by Ken Stringfellow of The Posies). Advantage, released in February of 2012, is now available for purchase online. An Extras album is also in the works including outtakes, alternate versions and original mixes from the sessions.

With the pressure on, the fledgling group of college friends logged a series of marathon practices holed up in stuffy basements and fly-ridden trailers. By the end of a long and rewarding summer of writing and performing, members Caleb Carpenter (vocals, guitar), Brian Hrubik (keys, guitar, vocals), Andrew Boyd (drums), and Seth Hayes (bass) discovered that their direction had evolved from a project into a calling. Since then, they have shared the stage with several national touring acts including Sanctus Real, Future of Forestry, Starfield, and Revive. Through recording their debut EP in the spring of '10 with producer Scott Campbell (Mainstay), Brightwork has forged their own sound amidst a sea of musical influences.

Painting the stages of love and loss, Benny's emotional  alternative folk-rock, sweetened with pedal steel, a horn section and  his own delicate guitar, is his coming of age as a solo artist.</p><p>In Los Angeles, Benny found his greatest acclaim to date, founding  the alternative rock band, Kings Royal.  In 2008, Kings Royal toured  extensively in support of fellow alt-rockers, Candlebox, whose Kevin  Martin was a fan; the two bands even shared musicians. However, Kings  Royal broke up the following year. The split created an opportunity for  Benny to pursue the sound he'd dreamed of . Soon he was taping his own  compositions.

A few of the home-recorded tracks from CD's he handed out at gigs turned up on the Internet via Napster and he started drawing a wider audience to his self-penned acoustic rock. He soon drew the attention of one of his biggest influences, Counting Crows lead singer Adam Duritz, who got wind of Colton's following and booked the emerging act to open on six weeks of the band's 2002 college tour. A record deal with Universal Republic followed and The Graham Colton Band quickly amped up their tour experience, joining the Crows several more times and hitting the road with the likes of John Mayer, Maroon 5, Train, Kelly Clarkson and Dave Matthews Band.</p><p>After three years of constant touring, Colton separated from his band and moved to Los Angeles where he spent a year writing songs and recording with producer John Fields (Switchfoot, Rooney, Semisonic).Although it can be said that the power of the story is in the telling, it's the tale itself that inspires the story to be told. Performance and delivery make up only one half of the equation; the other half is the feeling and emotion that inspires the creation of melodies and lyrics.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Graham Colton</span> <a href=""http://grahamcolton.com"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/grahamcolton "" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> |   	<a href=""http://www.myspace.com/grahamcolton"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> |  <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/grahamcolton"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/graham-colton/id49280333?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | 					 						<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/GrahamColton"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",11398,$12 advance/$15 day of,,10/2/11 0:00Motorbike&BodyArt MusicFest,,,0,,,11271,$7 ,,10/1/11 15:00Dubstep Dance Party - Featuring Andre Jetson,Instagib ,,0,Shux Dubstep,,10899,$10 ,,10/1/11 2:00River James,Mike Mangione & The Union,,0,,,10539,$10 adv / $13 day of,,9/30/11 0:00S��_an McCann (of Great Big Sea) & The Committed,,,0,,,0,$25 ,,9/28/11 23:30My Chikz Bad: Featuring Special Guest McTali,,,10998,,,10999,Tickets only available at door,,9/28/11 1:00Burlap to Cashmere,Shane Alexander,,0,,,11036,$12 ,,9/27/11 0:00Roger Henderson Memorial Benefit Concert,,,0,,,10951,$10 ,,9/25/11 17:00Adrian Belew Power Trio,,,0,,,0,$30 GA (VIP-SOLD OUT),,9/25/11 0:00The John Jorgenson Quintet,,,0,,,10770,$22 ,,9/24/11 0:00Miniature Tigers,The Blackberry Belles,,0,Dan NY,,0,$10 adv / $13 day of ,,9/23/11 0:00Jonas Sees In Color,The Baby Grand,,11260,TheRuinCity,,11261,"$10 adv/$13 day of",,9/21/11 23:30Ditched by Kate,Big Paper Airplanes,,0,Irresponsible,,0,$10 adv/$13 day of,,9/20/11 23:30Josiah Leming,Dion Roy,,0,,,11256,$10 ,,9/19/11 23:30The Movement,Three Legged Fox,,0,,,10710,$10 adv/$13 day of,,9/19/11 0:00"Rocknoceros ""Colonel Purple Turtle"" Official CD Release Show!",,,0,,,10373,$10 ,,9/17/11 15:00Kim Richey,Mando Saenz,,0,,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wandering the streets of Houston, playing regular gigs at bars like the Continental Club, or settling down for drinks with the kinds of characters that populate poetry (but rarely read it), Mando Saenz wrote it all down - in melody, on little scraps of paper, or in his head. Like the gloriously disorganized life he observed in his former neighborhood, his songs usually aren't about linear expectations or predictable narratives, they are flashes of emotion, snapshots of time reassembled in his songs with rhyme and melody to make uncommon, musical sense.  <br /> <br />He carried most of the songs from Houston to his new home in Nashville, finishing out a few of them with co-writers like Will Kimbrough, Kim Richey and R.S Field, a first for the previously lone writer.  The songs on his new album Bucket, are still populated with life's losers, soul-searchers, and dreamers - the kind songwriting that won him praise for his more acoustic-tinged debut, Watertown.

In a town  widely known for the tradition of country music, there&rsquo;s no denying that  Hoge has found a way to combine that with some rock, pop and soul to  make up his new, yet original sound. Spend some time with his music and  you&rsquo;ll hear and feel the collision of these musical styles that shapes  him, and you&rsquo;ll see the rebellious heart in the tradition of legendary  Nashville mavericks.</p><p>In 2008, Hoge was signed to the upstart Blackledge Music where he  recorded his first released studio album &ldquo;Everything She Was&rdquo;. Hoge  cowrote 10 of the 11 songs on the album that was produced by Marshall  Altman, and he worked with the likes of hitmakers Ne-Yo, Ryan Tedder,  Dave Barnes, Ashley Gorley, Drew Ramsey &amp; Shannon Sanders. Hoge has  been the poster boy for a true grassroots/touring musician, playing an  average of 175 shows a year, and selling more than 30,000 records out of  his van in just a short 3 year span.</p><p>Hoge is not only is an artist, but has also written or appeared on  songs for the likes of Backstreet Boys, Jesse Mccartney, Elliott Yamin,  Lupe Fiasco, Blake Lewis, Chris Richardson, Anoop Desai, Dave Barnes,  Matt Wertz and Ernie Halter.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Josh Hoge&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <a href=""http://jamminjava.com/home?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.joshhoge.com%2F"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://jamminjava.com/home?URL=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjoshhoge"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> |&nbsp;  	<a href=""http://jamminjava.com/home?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.myspace.com%2Fjoshhoge"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> |&nbsp; <a href=""http://jamminjava.com/home?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpages%2FJosh-Hoge%2F21180851933"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a><a href=""http://jamminjava.com/home?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpages%2FJosh-Hoge%2F21180851933"" target=""_blank""> </a>| <a href=""http://jamminjava.com/home?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fartist%2Fjosh-hoge%2Fid153021067%3Fuo%3D4%26amp%3BpartnerId%3D30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | 					 						<a href=""http://jamminjava.com/home?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2Fmrjoshhoge"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kevin Daniel is more than the cute blue-eyed surfer you could run into down at Santa Monica, the young singer-songwriter has spent the last couple months in the studio with producer Mikal Blue to work on his debut E.P.

Not only has O'Brother grown collectively, but individually as well, both musically and professionally.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">O'Brother</span>&nbsp;<a href=""http://twitter.com/obrothermusic"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> |   	<a href=""http://www.myspace.com/obrothermusic"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> |  <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/OBrotherMusic"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/obrother/id307150225?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | 					 					 						<a href=""http://youtube.com/cashcashmusic"" title=""Watch video from Cash Cash"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",0,$13 advance/$15 day of,,8/14/11 23:30Yonas,,,0,,,10346,$10 adv/$13 day of,,8/14/11 2:00Tyler Bryant,Gentlemen and Thieves,,0,,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",0,$10 ,,8/13/11 2:00Nikki Jean,Alex Miller,,0,,,10451,$10 ,,8/12/11 0:00Cash Cash,Breathe Electric ,The Baby Grand,0,For the Foxes  ,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />Hailing from Lake County, Illinois, Grant Harris formed electro-pop outfit Breathe Electric in 2008.

In 2010, Jenee released an EP entitled Hollow Bones, featuring a host of her musician friends including David Wax of the David Wax Museum.

Jenee has been working on her second full-length album on the West Coast.</p><p>""Warm and personal, her Emmylou Harris-like voice beckons the listener into the country folk songs with an invitingly crooked finger.""   -- Andy Fyfe, Q Magazine</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sam Friend's in a world of his own - a ghost poet with lyrical wiles, undying melodies, meandering wordplays, and shaggy dreams. His songs appear like keen jewels in the dust, and enter your consciousness filled with juicy ambiguity, though fine-tuned enough to remain there and unleash all manners of firepower imagery in your mind's eye.</p><p>For years, Friend wrote poems and played guitar separately. He began to create his own song structures combining jazz chord changes and stream-of-consciousness poems when he heard the Velvet Underground. And they started growing, taking shape organically like a green-baby Bob Dylan in their wit and sagacious demeanor. There are hooks in these songs, but more compelling is the mystery: a push-and-pull dichotomy for the listener to bridge the gap between the known and yet-to-be discovered.</p><p>In 2008, Friend released his proper debut, Secured and Fastened for Daisy Buchanan, recording it in Miami with Veltrac Music. Barry Gibb actually praised the album's single, ""Part of the Show"", when Friend was working on it at Gibb's home studio on Miami Beach. In 2010, he released Lady Madly, recording it himself in Seattle and delving into more exploratory territory with mandolins, accordions, and violins. He even designed the artwork under his own art group, Neat Knot Prods.</p><p>Presently based in New York City, Friend is now playing the city circuit and recording his third effort, Spirit Mirror, reflecting the singer-songwriter's peripatetic nature in finding new places, collaborators, muses, sensibilities, inspiration, and friends when producing a new album. He says this one will take on the notion of duality and capture the essence of a live show - another step forward for one of the most promising young singer-songwriters to emerge from Miami.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Sam Friend</span> <a href=""http://samfriend.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/5amfriend"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/samfriend"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sam-Friend/398437345766"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/sam-friend/id279932987?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/neatknot"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p>",0,$10 adv / $13 day of ,,7/31/11 23:30Better Said Than Done,,,0,,,10124,$10 ,,7/30/11 23:00The Bigger Lights,For The Foxes,,0,Aim For The Weekend,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ever since emerging in late 2007, For the Foxes has been delivering catchy songs to anyone within reach.

The college sophomore has taken inspiration from the ups and downs in his life to create extremely relatable music, no matter what one's mood is.   His presence on the stage may make you laugh even if he doesn't intend to be funny. (He tends to be a little awkward.)  If you are looking for a quick dose of empathy or a quick pick me up, then sit back and enjoy the sounds of Michael Butler.</p><p><a href=""http://www.themadisonproject.com/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Butler Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",10227,$10 ,,7/26/11 0:00Amy LaVere,Victoria Vox,,0,,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eclectic, upbeat and clever, Victoria Vox, has been warming the hearts of her audience across the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe.

He went from passing his songs around his old high school, to getting them in steady rotation on radio stations through the country, even in Germany. From wishing he knew just one celebrity, to knowing plenty on a first name basis. Saying all of this, you would think this kid is from a major known city like, Los Angeles, Atlanta or even D.C. But this kid is from a small countrytown in Virginia called Cumberland. Some recording artists get a taste of fame and forget about their city, but this kid never forgets about his roots. Many people who've met him, called him a different type of rapper, most rappers talk about the same ol' same (money, drugs and how many things they have) but Kalliko is mostly about love, life and talking about how he is. But not only is he different in his rhymes, he can rap over a techno, pop, r&amp;b or just a hip hop feel, he's not ust the ""basic"" rapper. With 2 independent albums, 3 EP's and many musical influences around him, Kalliko isn't even thinking of stopping anytime soon.</p><p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/rolan.mayo"" target=""_blank"">Kalliko Facebook</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The OK Corral began in the summer of 2007 as high school friends  Brett Nickley and Mike Matthews finished their freshman year of college.  The pair went to concerts together around the DC area and realized they  wanted to give the band thing a legitimate shot before school flew by  and the real world swallowed them whole. The OK Corral originated as an  acoustic duo, and Brett and Mike spent the summer writing 5 originals,  and following a plethora of makeshift and legitimate shows, these 5  original songs later became an EP in January 2008. While the duo was  eager to play their music to anyone who was willing to listen, they also  desired to form a full band. After getting their EP done, various  musicians temporarily got involved; practicing, playing shows, but  ultimately, not fitting into the bigger picture the two had envisioned.</p><p>The band has gained some national attention as they have been  featured as a band of the week in AbsolutePunk.net's self-promotion  spotlight drawing comparisons with the likes of Manchester Orchestra,  The Format, and Steven Kellogg and the Sixers. The OK Corral is  currently looking to bring their music to your ears. With their catchy  hooks, mature songwriting, and their outright eagerness to simply have a  good time with everyone who is a part of their live music experience,  they hope to be playing in a city near you in the near future!</p><p><a href=""http://www.theokcorralmusic.com/The_OK_Corral/Home.html"" target=""_blank"">The OK Corral Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",0,$10 adv / $13 day of ,,7/23/11 17:30Private Event,,,0,,,8568,,,7/22/11 22:002011 Lopez Spotlight Talent Competition,,,0,,,10413,$25 adv/ $30 at the door/ $20 group sales (10+) ,,7/22/11 0:00Private Event,,,0,,,9392,,,7/20/11 23:30Murphy's Kids,Mr. Dr. MC ,,10212,,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Irresponsible</strong> is an Alt Rock band from Vienna, Virginia, which draws its inspiration from Incubus, 311, Foo Fighters, RHCP, and the Beatles.

The themes of love, innocence, sex and nature prevail in its heartfelt, crafted songs. On the ambient, deeply resonant closer ""The Long Haul,"" Rowe's voice crackles with life.

Formed in 2008, Bronze Radio Return's line-up took a few years to solidify, though most of the band's members were orbiting each other for years at the Hartt School, one of the country's best schools of music, located in Hartford, Connecticut. For debut Old Time Speaker, the band relocated to Nashville for a two-week period, to, as Henderson puts it ""a place we'd never been with a producer we'd never met, and played a bunch of songs we'd never played before."" For such an inauspicious set of circumstances, the band managed a solid and well-received debut, and forged a lasting bond with producer Chad Copelin. Old Time Speaker established the band's relentless touring schedule, including an invitation to represent the Connecticut music scene by performing for President Obama at an event in Bridgeport, CT in 2010. Fan favorites ""Digital Love"" and ""Lo-Fi"" have been picked up for advertising and television licensing and the album landed on CMJ's Top 200 Album Chart.</p><p><a href=""http://www.bronzeradioreturn.com/"" target=""_blank"">Bronze Radio Return Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",0,$17 advance/ $20 day of ,,7/17/11 1:30Private Event,,,0,,,10327,,,7/16/11 15:00Big O and Dukes: Back to the Bunker One-Year Anniversary Party,,,0,,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",9666,$15 ,,7/16/11 2:00"ROCKNOCEROS presents The Hometown Debut of ""Colonel Purple Turtle""",,,0,,,0,$10 ,,7/15/11 23:30The Dinobabies,FeelFree,,0,,"<p>FeelFree's music was largely impacted by the Blues and Reggae, a powerful music of social consciousness and pulsating rhythms.

Hendrik abandonded his duties on the Bliksem and began to play songs with Mike full time with dreams of one day reaching America. Through match.com they met an all-American named Jeff because of their mutual affinity for Mexican food and music. Jeff cleared out his 401(k) and paid for plane tickets to bring his Icelandic friends to the states. To celebrate their safe arrival a dinner was held at Olive Garden. A young boy named Tom was their waiter. They were so impressed with his ability to keep their drinks refilled they made a request to purchase Tom from his supervisor. They took out loans to purchase equipment and began to spend hours watching commercials on American television. They played together for 15 minutes everyday writing songs.

Painting the stages of love and loss, Benny's emotional alternative folk-rock, sweetened with pedal steel, a horn section and his own delicate guitar, is his coming of age as a solo artist.</p><p>In Los Angeles, Benny found his greatest acclaim to date, founding the alternative rock band, Kings Royal.  In 2008, Kings Royal toured extensively in support of fellow alt-rockers, Candlebox, whose Kevin Martin was a fan; the two bands even shared musicians. However, Kings Royal broke up the following year. The split created an opportunity for Benny to pursue the sound he'd dreamed of . Soon he was taping his own compositions. The Kings Royal experience led to Cold Weather, a great new stage in a journey that will position Benny Marchant as a singer-songwriter to make his generation know their own hearts.</p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Benny Marchant</span>&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.bennymarchant.com/"" target=""_blank"">official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/BennyMarchant"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> |   	<a href=""http://www.myspace.com/bennymarchantmusic"" target=""_blank"">myspace</a> |  <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/people/Benny-Marchant/100000189066847"" target=""_blank"">facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/benny-marchant/id390190706?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">itunes</a> | 					 						<a href=""http://youtube.com/bennymarchant"" target=""_blank"">youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a></a></p>",0,$10 advance/ $13 day of ,,7/9/11 21:00He Is We,Ocean Grove,,0,Andrew Allen,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;""><br /></span></p><p><br /><a href=""http://oceangroveband.com/"" target=""_blank"">Ocean Grove Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Creating more than just a show, Andrew embraces and revels in the experience.

They have also supported  acts like Boys Like Girls, NeverShoutNever &amp; The Veronicas along  with festivals like Bamboozle and Warped Tour. The band released their 7  Song EP entitled ""The Stronger The Love"" August 2010. It debuted at #34  on Billboard's Heatseakers Chart &amp; by December 2010 has sold over  9,000 copies. In November, the band's lead single, ""Somewhere Out There""  landed regular rotation on Radio Disney and is currently in the Top 15  on their Countdown. 2011 will be without-a-doubt a breakout year for  Action Item.</p><p><a href=""http://www.actionitemband.com/"" target=""_blank"">Action Item Website </a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eager to perform for a larger audience, the Tarver's traveled to  Chattanooga, Tennessee in 2003 to audition for American Idol Juniors.  Katelyn's talent left the producers speechless and she was immediately  awarded a spot on the show. Katelyn received tremendous critical praise  from judges Deborah Gibson and legendary pop vocalist Gladys Knight, all  the while building a solid fan-base each week as one of the show's top  ten finalists. Upon Katelyn's return to Georgia, she began recording  demos and performing numerous shows at the encouragement of the Idol  judges and fans.</p><p>Katelyn worked for three years touring the country and winning the  attention of every audience she met. While out on the road with the  Jonas Brothers in the Fall 2007, Katelyn caught the eye of manager  Johnny Wright and soon after secured a management contract and an  invitation to join the ranks of some of the biggest names in the  business. Katelyn's path to her dreams hasn't always been a clear one  but with a strong foundation in place, her future appears more promising  than ever.</p><p><a href=""http://www.katelyntarveronline.com/"" target=""_blank"">Katelyn Tarver Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I LOVE MONSTERS is an indie pop four piece from New York City. The band formed in early 2008 and has quickly built a dedicated following. Their strong ""do-it-yourself"" work ethic, paired with their intense live shows, has made ILM as a band to watch. All of the group's music is self-produced and has been placed in a variety of television shows on NBC, MTV, A&amp;E, Sundance, and The History Channel. Their song ""Heart/Beat"" was also featured in the premiere episode of Entourage (Season 7) on HBO.</p><p>The band showcased during the 2010 CMJ Music Festival in New York City.</p><p>Find out why everyone LOVES Monsters!</p><p><a href=""http://www.ilovemonstersmusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">I Love Monsters Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",9558,$15 ,,3/29/11 23:30Duke Special,Eli Staples,,0,,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.<br /><br /></span></p><p>Eli Staples' dynamic piano and vocal performances blend virtuosic aspects of jazz pianists like Keith Jarret and Chick Corea with the contemplative temperament of singer-songwriters like James Taylor, Donny Hathaway and Stevie Wonder.</p><p>Since the age of 16, Eli Staples has been leaping across genres of music and styles.  With formal training as a classical organist and as a jazz pianist, he might have ended up immediately in the concert hall, but it was in the diverse music scene and nightlife of Washington, D.C. that he found his inspiration.  Consuming styles of music omnivorously, he has performed in a vast array of genres including jazz, rock, R&amp;B, cuban, Brazilian, funk, classical, and tango, and travelled around the world doing it.</p><p>He is now launching a new phase in his career as a singer/songwriter, performing pop/jazz originals and modern renditions of songs ranging from Dolly Parton and James Taylor to Stevie Wonder and John Legend.  His first EP is in production now, with a release planned for mid-2011.</p><p>Some of his previous career highlights include opening for Prince at the O2 arena in London with Mya, appearing on the Today show in Rockefeller Plaza with Ashanti for the release of her ""Chapter II"" album, and being a featured artist with the National Philharmonic at Strathmore Hall in Washington, D.C.   Performance credits include touring with R&amp;B artists Mya and Ashanti (both multi-platinum, Grammy award winning artists), jazz artists Nneena Freelon and Bryan Lynch (six-time Grammy nominee and Grammy award winner, respectively), and nationally known contemporary jazz artists Ken Navarro, Jaared, and Grainger.</p><p><a href=""http://www.elistaples.com/"" target=""_blank"">Eli Staples Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",8963,$10 ,,3/29/11 0:00Sick of Sarah + Hunter Valentine +  Curtis Peoples + Lucas Silveira,,,0,,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p><br />It has's been said that every generation needs a new revolution. Lucas Silveira's revolution began with a fearless attitude that embraced radical change.</p><p>Lucas founded The Cliks in 2004 when his musical identity shifted from being a solitary singer/songwriter to an all out rock n' roll front man. This shift reflected a vision he had carried his entire life and had now found a vehicle for.</p><p>After six years, two major record label releases (Snakehouse 2006/Dirty King 2009),international successes, multiple line up changes, major tours(True Colors 2007/2008, The Cult 2007/2008), TV appearances, awards (MTV Logo New Now Next Artist On The Brink, Chart Attack Pole 2009- Sexiest Man In Canda), breaking societal boundaries, and praise from his musical peers,(Cyndi Lauper, Margaret Cho, and The Cult's Ian Astbury) it became clear that the only constant in The Cliks was Lucas. His courageous attitude, rock star energy and progressive approach to self-determination have created an ever changing musical identity that encourages all outsiders to feel a sense of connection, belonging and mutual respect between audience and performer.</p><p>Unphased by life's transitions and struggles, Lucas has forged ahead by continuing to fulfill his vision of The Cliks.</p><p>Now traveling with a variety of guest performers, Lucas spearheads The Cliks' with the kind of attitude, grit and raw energy that has been compared to the likes of Green Day's Billie Joe, Joan Jett and Chrissie Hinde of The Pretenders.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thecliks "" target=""_blank"">Lucas Silveira of The Cliks MySpace </a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A songwriter with an understanding for what it takes to make a great pop record, Curtis Peoples crafts songs that fans of rock to acoustic folk and pop can enjoy. With a mix of big choruses and jumping rhythms, Curtis' style of ""coffee shop arena rock"" incorporates the radio-friendly and inspiring sounds of U2 and Bon Jovi as well as the rhythmic jazz-folk of John Mayer and Jason Mraz into his songs resulting in his own unique musical fingerprint. With the recent release of his Marshall Altman (Matt Nathanson, Kate Voegele) produced debut full length album, Peoples has developed a strong contingent of fans nationally. Constantly on the road, Curtis has toured with Tyler Hilton, Graham Colton, Josh Kelley, Stephen Kellogg, Tyrone Wells, and more. With his career on the rise, it is no surprise that LA's Music Connection Magazine has named Peoples as one of their ""artists to watch.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.curtispeoples.com/"" target=""_blank"">Curtis Peoples Website </a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There's this feeling you get when you have an intense crush. Your heart keeps pounding, ricocheting off your ribs for no reason. Randomly, buying milk at the grocery store or riding the bus, you notice a full-on flock of butterflies trying to escape from your stomach. Without realizing, you find yourself humming the sappiest AM radio hits every morning in the shower. Strangers at the coffee shop comment on the fact that you're grinning like an idiot. Everything seems so goddamned gorgeous. There are very few things that replicate that sense of total serotonin-charged exhilaration. Being perfectly drunk doesn't quite cut it. The only thing that comes even close is a particular kind of note-perfect, hook-drenched music.</p><p>When they first collided, back in the summer of 2004, the Toronto girl-group three-way composed of brazen singer/guitarist Kiyomi McCloskey, manic drummer Laura Petracca and classically trained bassist (and self-proclaimed music geek) Adrienne Lloyd coasted through kicky riffs, basic rhythms and spitfire lyrics with ease. Like any worthwhile lasting crush, it took a couple beats for them to secure a stranglehold around your heart.</p><p>Luckily, these girls were committed. They started busting their asses, scheduling rehearsals more often than most folks do the dishes. They played show after show, cementing their reputation as a stellar live band. Chemistry kicked in. Their songs got better and better. Just over a year later, Hunter Valentine was specially invited to play the prestigious North By Northeast festival and the Halifax Pop Explosion. Word got out. Canadian rock god Ian Blurton tracked them down and came on board to produce a self-titled demo EP. They shared stages with synth-pop stars Dragonette and UK garage-rock breakouts the Duke Spirit. By the summer of 2006, barely two years after they first formed, Hunter Valentine was ready for the world to fall in love with them.</p><p>By the time the season changed, Hunter Valentine had signed on with High Romance Music, a new imprint of True North Records.</p><p>Armed with a battalion of garage-rock anthems for heartbreakers and the brokenhearted, they recruited producer Julius Butty, best known for helping hone the razor-sharp edge on albums by Canuck screamo heroes Alexisonfire and the more contemplative City and Colour, and headed to the studio to create what would become their rock-solid, spectacular debut LP, The Impatient Romantic. Hunter Valentine's shimmering, serrated guitar riffs and galloping beats echoed off the quiet streets of rural Stoney Creek, Ontario. They synchronized handclaps over whiskey in backwater bars. They managed to capture every rapture, every rejection, every moment of redemption, every hapless last-call bar pickup, every lonely walk home on a freezing snowy night, every story of a great love gone off the rails... all of it on tape.</p><p>Prepare yourself for Hunter Valentine: a love like this doesn't happen every day.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/huntervalentine"" target=""_blank"">Hunter Valentine MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",8535,$10 adv / $13 day of ,,3/26/11 21:00Matt Wertz,Ben Rector,,0,,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p><br />If there is one thing I know to be true about music, it is this: Writing a great, enduring pop song is hard as Chinese arithmetic. You want it to be contemporary, but you want it to last. You want it to be hooky, but not so much it loses heart. And you want it to feel familiar but not so much so that it is played out by the third or fourth listen. Great pop-songwriters teeter down a narrow musical path keeping one eye on what's happening around them, one on where they are heading and one on where they have been. Then they blend it all together into a perfect musical cocktail. It's true. And that's exactly what Ben Rector does.</p><p>Ben cut his musical teeth while a student at the University of Arkansas and used them over the next four years to devour the music scene in Fayetteville and floss with the surrounding states. While for many his songs make up the soundtrack for life on campus, his music quickly spilled past the walls of the university and into the playlists of audiophiles around the southeast. Now Ben is all growed up and on an upward trajectory towards being one of the most sought after independent musicians performing today.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/benrector"" target=""_blank"">Ben Rector MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span></span></p>",8856,$15 adv / $18 day of ,,3/26/11 17:00Private Event,,,0,,,7514,,,3/26/11 0:00"Sireedee Entertainment presents: Indonesian Guitarist Extraordinaire ""Balawan""  Batuan Ethnic Fusion",,,0,,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",8831,$10 for everyone 8 years old and above,,3/24/11 22:00"Ron Sexsmith ""Long Player Late Bloomer"" CD Release",Caitlin Rose,,0,,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></p><p><br />Caitlin Rose is a twenty one year old singer/songwriter from Nashville, TN, who is spending more time recreating the songs of our past than most artists twice her age are able to do. Upon first listen, you might swear you've heard Caitlin's music before. Perhaps in a smoky honky-tonk or a dimly lit dive bar where the waitresses are all named Wanda and the well drinks are only a dollar. Though this would simply be an auditory illusion, your first impression wouldn't be far from the truth.</p><p>Caitlin Rose, though young, has learned from the ""Queens of Country"", and she delivers her sonically seductive tunes with a set of pipes that would make Loretta herself proud.</p><p>Accompanied by instrumentation that harkens back to the likes of Gram Parson or Hank Williams, Rose performs songs that range from genuinely poignant ballads to tongue-in-cheek tales of teenage pregnancy and primate love. Sometimes sparse and naked, other times robust, her music is laid out as an offering before the Gods of Americana, Folk and Country music.</p><p>The Dead Flowers EP is a candid glimpse of Caitlin's soul -- one that truly may have been forged at the crossroads of Country and Western.

Miss Shevaughn grew up performing folk music in Arkansas with her family and went on to study opera and Yuma Wray is a veteran of D.C.'s hardcore scene.

Far from urban and suburban life, with its movie theaters, shopping malls, and other quintessentially American preoccupations, I was free to entertain myself outdoors, exploring the town (unsupervised) on my bike, and indoors, playing our Baldwin upright piano as loudly as I could.  My parents encouraged this, egging me on with vinyl records of 1970s songwriters like James Taylor, Joni Mitchell, and Randy Newman.  This digest of folk singers was punctuated by a yearly pilgrimage to the great city of Jackson, MS for its Celtic Arts and Music Festival, where I joined the chorus of foot-stomping and loud whooping, wide-eyed with wonder at the beauty and power of shared music.</p><p>Moving from the piano, I picked up a guitar, survived a close encounter with punk rock music in middle school, and found myself in college forming a bluegrass band named for local topography-the Paris Mountain Pickers.  Somewhere along that road, I began songwriting in the folk tradition of my youth.</p><p>Now in Washington, DC, I continue to ride my bike unsupervised, and after some initial culture shock, my rural soul has accepted its transplant into urban soil.  In bars and coffee shops around the District, I perform honest songs that tell true stories about small towns, seasonal affective disorder, and migratory anomalies of Canadian geese, typically to warm and enthusiastic receptions.</p><p>2009 marked the release of my first independent record-Find Your Way Home-to local and familial acclaim.  Its music grows from the fertile soil of my influences, the American folk/singer-songwriter tradition, Scotch/Irish jigs and reels, and African-American soul/Motown.  Find Your Way Home is the beginning of what I hope will be a long and eclectic journey, starting, as it should, in the place from which I come.</p><p><a href=""http://www.wendellk.com/wendellk.com/Welcome.html"" target=""_blank"">Wendell Kimbrough Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",8828,$10 adv / $13 day of ,,3/21/11 0:00afton,Forever The Win + Brian Coyne & White Loafer ,Kedromelon + DJ CATS + TreyFrey + Bad Krohma,0, Sould Craft + Alexander Bryant,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>Please note that advance tickets for this show cannot be purchased through Jammin' Java.

After forming the band in late 2007 and recording their debut Self-Titled EP in Los Angeles, California, Safety Word Orange moved back to their hometown of Richmond, Virginia to continue the movement they started out west.</p><p>Safety Word Orange was formed when lead singer James Mason met guitarist Robbie Rusbuldt in Los Angeles in late 2007. Upon returning to Virginia they began searching for a more permanent line-up. The first addition was guitarist Jackson Wise, followed by Reid Taylor on the bass and last was Travis King on drums.</p><p>In 2008 SWO was named ""Indie Artist of the Year"" by Music Emissions who said, ""Safety Word Orange has a great start here; they have the ability to write power-pop songs that have a feel good vibe."" Their pop-rock instrumentals are the foundation behind lead singer James Mason's strong and raspy vocals, backed by the clear tones of both Wise and Rusbuldt. ""With as much musicianship as you can handle, Safety Word Orange is one of the best bands you've never heard."" says Starpulse.com.</p><p>During the winter of 2009 SWO recorded at Red Wire Audio in Beltsville, MD with acclaimed producer Bryan Russell, (Straylight Run, Envy On the Coast) After months of promotion and touring, Safety Word Orange released their Sophomore EP, ""On Your Mark, Get Set..."" on May 18th.</p><p>Since the release of their new EP Safety Word Orange has received plenty of press attention. In August they were featured in Alternative Press in the AP&amp;R section as one of their top unsigned artists of the month. The record got great reviews from places like Absolutepunk.net, Pastepunk.com and many other online blogs. They were also featured in Substream Music Press' Unsigned Artists section which said, ""[Safety Word Orange] is defining the barriers of 'pop' while still holding on to that catchy sound that keeps songs in your head for hours.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/safetywordorange"" target=""_blank"">Safety Word Orange MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",8670,$10 adv / $13 day of ,,3/20/11 0:00Boys Will Be Boys,Greater Risk,,0,Andrew Rohlk ,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Early show!</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/andrewrohlk "" target=""_blank"">Andrew Rohlk MySpace</a></p><p><br />The Greater The Risk was formed in January 2010 by recent college graduates guitarist Ashley Drewes, bassist Nate Wilson, and vocalist Deek Kaufman. After several months of lineup changes they found guitarist/vocalist Blake Gillespie and drummer Derek Ames to help round out their sound. The sound you ask? It is the life experience discovered at school, the triumph and heartache of friendships and relationships, the culmination of a part of life and commencement of another. Using influences ranging from Anberlin to Mae, Cartel to Jimmy Eat World, they have crafted songs that speak of these familiarities.</p><p>Just less than a year old, The Greater The Risk is making a name for themselves by earning awards such as Syke Energy&iacute;s &igrave;Band of the Month&icirc; and their single &igrave;Braver&icirc; topping at #13 on Purevolume.com.

With the philosophy that everyone should have an equal say, it is no surprise that the band's authentic hybrid sound is actually as eclectic as they claim it to be. Genuine variety is what is important to them and that is blatant to anyone that listens to the band. Fusing musical influences from Rage against the Machine, Tool, European bands such as Muse, and the pop-punk spunk energy of Paramore, the band defines a new genre of rock.</p><p>Playground Etiquette's debut album, ""Hit the Lights"", was described as a ""refreshing piece of cross-genre magic"" (Unwind Magazine) and guarantees a successful fusion of different styles of music. From melodic vocal lines to intricate guitar solos to heavy break downs that even a timid spectator would move to, all four members - Athena, Mason, Johnny, and Andrew - come together to pour a disturbing amount of high energy and musicality into each song, leaving listeners jaw-dropped and begging for more from an iPod to the stage.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/playgroundetiquette"" target=""_blank"">Playground Etiquette's MySpace</a></p><p><br />Big Paper Airplanes are living proof that raw talent, experience, and honest song writing still exist in the world of rock. The members of this Baltimore, MD band - singer/guitarist Ian Kaine MacGregor, guitarist Dennis Kapoyos, bassist Bryan Kimes and drummer Brian Fasani - all came from successful, production heavy acts but Big Paper Airplanes had to be different.</p><p>Influenced and inspired by everything from Cold Play to All American Rejects, they set out to record a CD free of synthesizers and overused production effects. The result is their debut EP ""Under Blue Skies"". Five well crafted and engineered songs that display the vast range that Big Paper Airplanes is capable of.</p><p>The band plan to take the same approach with their live show: no samples, no triggers - just four guys with guitars and drums. With the February release of their EP, their live debut on Mardi Gras (03.08.11), and several other live dates in the works, 2011 promises to be a special year for Big Paper Airplanes.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/bigpaperairplanes"" target=""_blank"">Big Paper Airplanes MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kurtis was a finalist in VH1's Song of the Year competition for his inspirational tune ""Everything that You Are."" Kurtis also gained national exposure through American Idol's fourth season, where he climbed to the top 50 finalists. After Idol, he joined forces with longtime friend and bandmate Josh Kim to form ""the Season"". The Season has been featured nationally on CNN, NBC, and the Fox Morning show, with Kurtis' song ""Forever Changed."" The song was written for the Virginia Tech families that were affected by tragedy of April 16, 2007. The song was one of the first ever to reach 1 on a top 40 radio format from an independent artist, and was the most requested song of the year on Roanoke, VA's popular K92 Radio.</p><p>Having written over 1200 songs in every genre since the age of 13, this young talent is a diamond in the rough among songwriters and is quickly becoming a fan favorite with Indie pop/rock listeners. His songs have won the ""Track of the Week"" and numerous ""track of the day"" awards on Garageband.com and he was nominated for Artist of the Month out of over 8,000 bands on Stereofame.com, where he's been featured Artist of the Week. His band, the Season also reached 16 worldwide on Myspace.com's Unsigned Pop Artists. As a writer, Kurtis has penned songs with some amazing chart-topping lyricists, including Calvin Nowell, Keith Dudley, Scott Davis, and Aaron Rice.</p><p>Whether writing and recording in his home studio, or out on the road leading worship at camps, churches, and conferences, it's obvious that music is as natural as breathing for Kurtis.</p><p><a href=""http://kurtisparks.com"" target=""_blank"">Kurtis Parks Band Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Static Cinema is the best you've never heard! This brand new rock sensation started late summer 2009 and has just recently become a hit to the local VA music scene. Static Cinema consists of five members ranging from ages 16-19, Jon Cresswell, Noah Moore, Danny Slovich, Stephen Goodrick, and Zack Ticer. Their mission is to share positive music that turns your frown upside down and helps make your day a little better.</p><p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/StaticCinema"" target=""_blank"">Static Cinema Facebook</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",8307,$12 adv / $15 day of,,3/5/11 2:00That 1 Guy,,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",6970,$15 ,,3/4/11 23:00Atomic Tom,Andy Zipf,,0,,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Late Show!<br /></span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p><br />There is music that you listen to and then there is part of you that is music.</p><p>For every single one of those people who believe in the power of melodies, the transcendence of a chorus, and to those people who hold onto the idea that ""pop"" doesn't have to be synonymous for ""crap""-Andy Zipf makes the music that will soundtrack your existence.</p><p>Honesty and beauty are two rare things in the fragmenting music world today, but Zipf has been dealing in both for a long time. Refusing to artistically compromise or settle, Zipf has maintained independence and credibility in the face of pressures to conform to a certain sound or stereotype. The music that comes out of the speakers when Andy Zipf steps to the microphone is completely and uniquely tied to the silky voiced singer and no one else. Zipf makes the music that he wants to make, not what any type of demographic or cult-following might demand.</p><p>Zipf has brought that experience to 37 different states and played over 400 shows in the last three years. A PurePick at Purevolume twice, Zipf has attracted the attention of The Today Show, XM Satellite Radio, VH1 and MTV by building a growing and sustainable model that relies on a stunning live performance, amazing music and a close connection to his audience. He's opened for a laundry list of talented artists and has released two gorgeous albums, ""I Stole the Morning Sun,"" ""The Long Tail,"" and far too many singles. For his latest, The Long Tail, Zipf raised $45,000 to produce the record with industry veteran James Barber (Ryan Adams, Hole, Guns N Roses), through a series of fundraising concerts, house shows and investor parties-people believe in Andy Zipf.</p><p>For Zipf, music is about more than posturing and preening to impress critics and cults; it's about communication and community. It's about creating music that does more than tickle ears, it changes hearts. Its music that reminds you that ""pop"" wasn't always a dirty word and a harmonious chord progression isn't necessarily a bad thing.It's music for every lonely spirit, every love starved child, and every person who believes that hunger for music means more than a social status symbol.</p><p><a href=""http://www.andyzipf.com/"" target=""_blank"">Andy Zipf Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",8485,$12 ,,3/4/11 0:00Atomic Tom,Hotspur,,0,,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">Early Show!</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""><br /></span></p><p>In the past couple of years Hotspur has gone from hype machine to independent power-house. After 100,000 miles on the road, and 10,000 copies of their first album ""Beta"" sold, the band has clearly established itself as one of the hottest bands on the rise. ""Beta"", has been referred to as a collection of radio ready singles, and with 8 out of the 10 songs landing on MTV shows, the band has gained an overwhelming amount of media buzz, and a fan base to support it. With a brand new album that showcases Hotspur's dance floor energy and their emotional piano based sound on the verge of completion, you should be expecting to hear a lot more about the band in the new year.</p><p>""New Artist of the Year"" - Washington Area Music Association<br />2010 Grand Prize Winner ""Artist on the Verge"" - New Music Seminar</p><p><a href=""http://www.hotspurmusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Hotspur Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",8342,$12 ,,3/2/11 23:30Tracy Bonham + Jim Boggia + Bleu,,,0,,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;""><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></span></p><p>Boggia has gained impressive career momentum in a short amount of time. Blackberry selected one of his tracks for a new ad campaign and his songs have also been featured on MTV's Real World and ABC-TV's Men In Trees. He's developed a loyal grass-roots fan base for his dynamic, improvisational live shows. His work has been embraced by numerous fellow artists and kindred spirits, many of who have lent their talents to Boggia's albums. His sophomore release, Safe In Sound (2005, bluhammock music), featured key contributions from such notable admirers as Aimee Mann, Jill Sobule, MC5 guitar hero Wayne Kramer, Attractions drummer Pete Thomas and legendary '70s cult-pop icon Emitt Rhodes. <a href=""http://jimboggia.com/"" target=""_blank""></a></p><p><a href=""http://jimboggia.com/"" target=""_blank"">Jim Boggia Website</a></p><p><br />The gifted pop-rocker's effusive words don't refer to the creation of his dynamic, highly personal new album, Four. Nor do they reflect his work as co-writer with chart-topping acts like the Jonas Brothers and Selena Gomez. Rather, they convey his response to the astonishing generosity of his fans, who helped him raise $40,000 following the launch of his campaign on DIY fundraising site Kickstarter.</p><p>As a result of fans' contributions, he's been able to launch his own record label and put Four out himself in North America (U.K. indie Lojinx acquired the rights to release the record across the pond).<br />In addition to his solo work, production projects (Drake Bell, TV/TV, Air Traffic Controller, Chris Mann) and commercial tunesmithery, Bleu has organized and/or lent his voice and playing to inventive side projects like the rock band The Major Labels (with his pals and fellow pop geeks Mike Viola and Ducky Carlisle); the one-off ELO tribute L.E.O. (featuring Andy Sturmer of power-pop legends Jellyfish, Hanson, Matt Mahaffey of Self, and countless other aficionados of Jeff Lynne's musical confections); LoudLion (with Taylor Locke of Rooney); and numerous others.</p><p>He's also toured widely, sharing stages of late with Rooney, The Posies, Katie Herzig, Graham Colton, Creed Bratton of The Office, John Doe, Mike Viola, Derek Webb and Drake Bell, joining Tracy Bonham for a string of dates in 2010, and performing intimate shows on his own - usually with just his acoustic guitar and an impressively large-sounding collection of loops and effects, but also sometimes as a duo with drummer Joe Seiders.</p><p>Such appearances are a chance for Bleu not only to display his uncanny way with a melody but also to express his gratitude to the fans who've made this new phase of his career possible.</p><p><a href=""http://www.bleutopia.com/"" target=""_blank"">Bleu Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",7786,$12 adv / $15 day of ,,3/1/11 23:30Ian Axel,Sub-Radio Standard,,0,,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""><br /></span></p><p>Sub-Radio Standard originated with Matt and John messing around with covers and attempting original songs in Matt's basement in 2005.

The foursome is comprised of childhood friends who developed their craft by playing in various rock bands in the Maryland area. This experience during their formative years enabled the band to gain valuable stage experience while experimenting with a wide variety sounds. McTwist loves to put on a show. Their mix of humor and music is present in everything they do. Since their inception, McTwist has developed an unyielding work ethic, an unmistakable sound, and a dedicated fan base.</p><p>With their highly anticipated sophomore effort, ""Ifs, Ands, or Butts,"" McTwist is excited about continuing to grow as musicians and as people. The album is an exemplar of what makes McTwist distinctive: powerful guitars, exceptional harmonies, and a driving rhythm section. They play a brand of rock that is dedicated to being true to their wide-ranging influences, drawing equally from all genres, ranging from Motown to modern pop. McTwist is as comfortable sweating and jumping through a two-hour electric performance, as they are entering into a songwriter's circle and completely stripping down their music.

They came together in early 2010 and instantly broke out with a promising five-track EP and a stream of local performances, including a headlining gig at the 9:30 Club. Singer Ryan Murphy brings a full vocal range and charisma to the already steady, seasoned backdrop of D.C.'s most beloved rock-soul band, Politicks (guitarist Mike Trella and drummer Brendan McCourt) along with new bassist Mike Tony Echols and guitarist Dan Mudge. With multiple decades of professional musicianship between them, these Thieves expertly blend rock, alternative, and dance music into a sultry, pleasantly infectious groove of their own.</p><p>Modern Thieves recorded an original EP (entitled MDRN THVS) around the winter holidays and blizzards of 2009/2010 at Inner Ear Studios in Arlington, VA where many seminal punk records were made (Fugazi, Bad Brains, Minor Threat). The band is currently working on their debut full length album, recording with acclaimed jazz pianist Marcus Johnson at his Studio 8121 in Silver Spring, MD.

During these ears, John played guitar for Gospel band on Sunday mornings.

Cerca Trova has been together since October 2005. They have a very refreshing sound and incredible stage presence. When they first started to play together, they came to it for the music and nothing more. Ever since day one it's been a group effort to achieve a common goal, the goal to share their music with as many people as possible. Every time they step onto a stage they are reminded of that and strive to put on the best performance they can.</p><p>Cerca Trova consists of four members, Jordan Waddell (Lead Vocals), Angelo Soares (Guitar), Dave Wernli (Bass), and Josh Cockrell (Drums). Jordan Waddell has had a passion for singing for a very long time and lets everyone know ita s soon as he steps on stage. Some of his influences are: Brandon Boyd of Incubus, David Grohl of The Foo Fighters, Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, Anthony Kiedis, and Paul McCartney. Angelo Soares has been in many different bands and has a lot of experience. He also has a very unique style when it comes to playing and writing music. Some of his influences are: Yngwie Malmsteen, Steve Val, Led Zeppelin, Fall of Troy, and B.B. King. Then there's Dave Wernli. Dave has a very unique style and has a broad range of influences some of which would be flea from Red Hot Chilli Peppers, The Used, and Fall of Troy. Finally, there is Josh Cockrell. Josh has been drumming for most of his life and was the captain of the Chantilly Drumline his senior year of high school. Some of his influences are John Bonham, Buddy Rich, and Bill Bachman. This four piece is very cultured band and lets it be known through their music.</p><p>The eclectic repertoire of Cerca Trova has grown even greater lengths with personal friendships as time has passed. They really strive to take their art to the next level. All four members have a great passion that cannot be defined in words, and with this great passion comes even more determination to succeed. Cerca Trova definitely has something to say and wants it to be known. They are a great act to be seen and should not be missed.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/cercatrovarock"" target=""_blank"">Cerca Trova MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the past three years The Influence has been busy immersing itself into what has become a vibrant East Coast rock scene. Thriving on their hybrid fusion of acoustic and electric sounds, luscious counter-melodies and five part harmonies, The Influence has established their presence amongst the elite rockers of today.</p><p>The five piece (originating from Virginia) is influenced by the familiar sounds of the great 90s rock movement but is undeniably rooted in late 60s and early 70s rock sensibility. Matthew Archer Stephenson's smokey, Peter Gabriel reminiscent vocals provide a candid look at the harsher, more provocative themes usually locked deep within the vaults of the more tortured minds. The passion set forth is striking and effervescent when played in conjunction with the hard thumping beats of drummer Collin Cogan and Bassist Chris Tully. Their on stage delivery is pure chaos in its' search for perfection. An influence show is pure expulsion usually leaving a stage dismantled and the audience enamored.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/theinfluence"" target=""_blank"">The Influence MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",7565,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,2/11/11 23:00The Civil Wars,Lucy Schwartz,,0,,"<p><strong>EARLY SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.<br /></em></p><p><br />Her latest CD, Life in Letters, introduces the new 20 year-old face of Lucy Schwartz, but listeners may already know her voice. How could anyone forget it? Rich and dreamy and all lit up in Technicolor, it's graced movie theaters and TV sets across the country. ""Darling I Do,"" is one example: Lucy created the love theme to Shrek Forever After and performed the song with her co-writer Landon Pigg on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter has also written for numerous films including Mother &amp; Child, Post Grad, Adam, and the Meg Ryan comedy The Women, for which she created songs for both the front and end credits while still in high school. She recently penned the international theme song for Parenthood, and her songs have been featured in more than a dozen hit television shows, from Grey's Anatomy to Make it Or Break It; ER to Brothers and Sisters. For Schwartz, who sang the hilariously campy jingles ""Mister F"" and ""For British Eyes Only"" on Arrested Development, drama comes naturally. ""I did a lot of theater growing up,"" says the effervescent Lucy, ""so I like the idea of escaping into a character and becoming someone else.""</p><p>Now, Life in Letters establishes Lucy Schwartz as a major talent, big and bright and bursting with energy. She recorded the album with producer Mitchell Froom (Elvis Costello, Paul McCartney). ""There was a lot of experimentation,"" she recalls. ""We didn't have a band come in and play together. We did it part by part."" Froom's home studio in Los Angeles served as their playground. ""The whole place was filled up with keyboards,"" Schwartz continues, ""so for 'Graveyard,' we layered ten different keyboard parts at once. For 'Those Days,' I found these bells and hit them with a yellow toy hammer. Now, some songs are a little zanier than they were when we started, but they're also a lot more interesting.""</p><p>Lucy commands dramatic torch songs and breezy pop ditties with equal vigor, bringing a spectacular whimsy to everything she does, adding ukulele or a capella harmonies where you'd least expect them, cranking up every emotion into surround sound. There's so much joie de vivre in her music, she's written no less than two songs - ""Graveyard"" and ""Shadow Man"" - about what it takes to feel truly alive. ""I feel like I'm always asking myself, 'Am I living a fulfilling life? Am I making the most of my time?'"" says Schwartz. ""When I wrote 'Shadow Man,' I'd just decided to leave college. I needed to do what I needed to do and not just what I was expected to do. And I needed to make music.</p><p>One of the most playful songs is called ""I Want the Sky"" - which should tell you something about Schwartz's ambitions. ""I have all these crazy schemes and dreams that most people are too afraid to ask for,"" she admits. A longtime fan of Landon Pigg, she simply wrote to him and asked him to play Shrek to her Fiona on ""Darling I Do"", the song from Shrek Forever After. A fan of Matt Hales - aka Aqualung -- Lucy contacted the brooding Brit to sing with her on ""Seven Hours,"" included as a bonus track on Life in Letters. The tactic worked again for the ""Graveyard"" video: after marveling at an episode of So You Think You Can Dance, she wrote the show's Sonya Tayeh and asked her to choreograph the video for ""Graveyard."" Tayeh accepted: now Schwartz uses her moves in the clip, twirling and jumping through a smoke-machine haze. ""I like to have everything just the way I'd imagined it, from the artwork to the visuals to the songs,"" she admits. ""You might call me an artiste,"" she proclaims in a haughty French accent, before dissolving into laughter.</p><p>Funny as it might seem, it's also true. Lucy Schwartz is an emerging artist who's deeply engaged with the world - the good stuff, and the bad. And Life in Letters challenges that world to engage with her the same way. ""Lucy Schwartz literally means 'light dark,' and I tend to write that way, too,"" she says. ""Some songs seem bright and happy but the words are more thoughtful and introspective. Others feel darker, but I sound more hopeful. Sometimes you can hear both the light and dark in my voice."" True, you already knew that voice. But thanks to Life in Letters, you'll now remember her name.</p><p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings> <o:AllowPNG /> </o:OfficeDocumentSettings> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso

produced, and sung. For it to come from someone just out of high school, and this mature a work, is nothing short of amazing."" -Michael Jaworek, The Birchmere</p><p>""She sings. It's what she does. Atlantic Records recording artist Chelsea Lee sings like she means it, with a voice that services the emotion of the song. It's a voice that carries joy and pain into the heart of the listener, with unbridled passion that borders on obsession.</p><p>So let's get this out of the way now: Chelsea Lee is 18. As in, born in 1991.</p><p>It's not a gimmick, it's just the chronological way things are. It's too easy to say she sings beyond her years, but she does. The maturity and professionalism showcased on stage and on disc are hallmarks of seasoned veterans, yet the chestnut haired charmer - who carries herself with the same sophistication as she performs - has it all. And she mixes the professionalism with youthful enthusiasm because singing is fun. It's what she does.</p><p>And she writes the songs that she sings, which may be why she sings them to perfection. The songs are soulful folk with a modern pop sheen that showcase those beyond-her-years vocals.</p><p>Having signed with Atlantic Records, Chelsea's future is bright. There's plenty of time. After all, she is only 18."" -Buzz McClain, The Washington Post</p><p><a href=""http://chelsealeemusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Chelsea Lee Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em></em></p>",8230,$10 adv / $13 day of ,,2/10/11 0:00An Intimate Evening with SGG,,,0,,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;""><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></span></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;""><em><br /></em></span></p>",8392,$25 ,,2/8/11 23:30PROJECT/OBJECT Featuring IKE WILLIS,,,0,,"<p><span style=""color: #888888;""><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",8067,$20 ,,2/7/11 23:30Chris Ayer + John Schmitt + Barnaby Bright + Morgan Holland,John Schmitt ,Morgan Holland,0,Barnaby Bright ,"<p><em><span style=""color: #888888;"">This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</span></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/morganholland"" target=""_blank"">Morgan Holly Myspace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/barnabybright "" target=""_blank"">Barnaby Bright MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Schmitt was born and raised in Buffalo, NY, and his songs are a direct reflection of his experiences growing up there. His simple, honest approach tells stories that hit at the heart of American life. Blending a folk-meets-soul style to go along with thoughtful lyrics and images, John sings about his life in real terms. His album ""Ophelia,""  is his loftiest work to date. Produced by Caleb Hawley, we see on ""Ophelia"" just how life in the city has affected Schmitt, now a resident of Brooklyn, as he takes us along for many stories of life, love, loss, and coffee

That's probably the first thing you thought to yourself when you came across this Rock/Reggae band from Northern Virginia. When the band first came together in March of 2008, it was just a random assortment of words they would say to each other. After putting together an arsenal of catchy tunes and playing 100's of hard-hitting live performances, the name has evolved into many different meanings. The band's music promotes a strong community, individual strength, good times, and lessons learned. Bass player Corey Sullivan shares, ""Feed God Cabbage means whatever you want it to. But if you ask me, it means that people shouldn't take life so seriously. Sit back and enjoy the ride. Just take it easy when you have the opportunity. Life's short, live it up.""</p><p>Emerging from Springfield VA, Feed God Cabbage is raising the bar and setting the pace in the local DMV music scene. In May of 2009, they released their first CD titled ""We the People."" The compilation of music is a great taste of the upbeat reggae style, heavy guitar riffs, smooth bass lines, and meaningful lyrics that the band produces. After launching the physical CD, the EP was posted on all major download sites including iTunes and CDbaby.</p><p>What has really made this band gain recognition is their incredible on-stage live performances at local venues like State Theatre, Fat Tuesdays, JAXX, and Jammin Java. Many are impressed by the multi-talents of Dylan Sajbel, who is the drummer and the lead singer. The band has also had great success at the many state colleges of Virginia including JMU, Virginia Tech, George Mason, VCU, and Radford. Guitar player Aaron March commented, ""You can't beat playing a show onstage in front of a sold out crowd. But some of my favorite shows are the house parties. We always end up having a good time because we get to party along with our fans.""</p><p>Only after a year since they released their first demo, Feed God Cabbage has begun to open for established local bands and national acts like SOJA, Ballyhoo, HR, Mike Pinto, and Murphy's Kids. It's amazing how this band has evolved from a party band, to a fully fledged professional rock band. The talents of this young ensemble continue to emerge with every performance. Come out and see the band that everyone in the DMV area is raving about!

Their music speaks for itself; high energy, catchy songs with a musical  flair that at times recalls the grooves of Michael Jackson, the vocal  harmonies of the Four Freshmen, and the instrumental fluidity of Return  to Forever. ""Wait, those aren't rock bands!"" you might say; and yes  you're correct. But Mercury in Summer is. Tip-toeing the line between  familiar and strange, fans say that Mercury in Summer seems to  effortlessly incorporate other genres into their style. And you'll be  saying the same thing, especially after seeing them live.</p><p>Yes, things have been going pretty well for Mercury in Summer lately;  considering their recent airplay on DC101 and 98 rock, trips around the  U.S. to play festivals exceeding 17,000 attendees (Gathering of the  Vibes), and a surge of interviews from college radio and newspapers a  like. Fans and listeners a like agree, this band has it.

After giving a demo to the label's representative, they were invited to showcase their songs at the Tooth &amp; Nail headquarters in Seattle. A week later, Brandon Ebel called and offered them a recording contract.</p><p>With song inspiration ranging from a Pride &amp; Prejudice moment of hopeless romanticism (""Safe to Say"") to an ode to a shall-remained nameless member of the opposite sex (""Blue Sweater""), Shealeen and Elle love serving up these melodic slices of life to a broad audience.</p><p>""Whenever we're going through a situation, even a rough one, instead of getting mad about it, we'll just go write a song about it."" Elle says. ""And because we're writing music with such universal themes, it ends up appealing to everyone, which is exactly what a good song does for us, regardless of the musical genre.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/poemaofficial"" target=""_blank"">Poema MySpace</a></p><p><br />A four piece Electro Dance Rock band out of Kansas City, Missouri.

Local alternative radio station, 96.5 the buzz, got the single and took note of the band, playing them on their Sunday night series, ""Homegrown Buzz"", a local music showcase. Positive listener feedback on 96.5 the Buzz gave Queens Club a chance to play for a larger crowd when they opened for Say Anything at Kansas City Power &amp; Light Districts Summer Concert Series.

Growing up in a large military family in rural King George, Virginia, I realized at a young age that music was the one thing that gave me true peace and happiness while sharing space with seven brothers and two sisters. I can remember having one of the first generation ""walk-man"" radios and singing quietly to the latest hits on the radio. I couldn't seem to catch a baseball to save my life and getting crushed every time the football was passed my way wasn't my idea of fun so I found my friends on the radio. KISS,Parliament Funkadelic, The Jacksons, Zeppelin, Aretha, Elton, Prince, The Stones and later U2 and The Clash. Whatever came across the airwaves at the time, I was off somewhere by myself singing it. It became an early passion, this singing thing. I eventually gathered the courage to sign up for a talent show at my school.I would race home every day and secretly rehearse for the show. I can remember not telling anyone I had signed up for the show until I walked onto the stage. The place went crazy when I took the stage. I walked away the winner that day and the seed was planted.</p><p>Music was my motivation from that point forward. That motivation got me a music scholarship at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia and I was soon approached to be the lead singer of an upstart band called Boy O Boy (BOB). We quickly gained a following, and toured the East Coast playing many clubs, colleges and well anywhere that would feed us, pay us a little cash and give us a place to catch a nap before we were off to the next town.</p><p>We changed our name to Fighting Gravity some years later, and found ourselves signed to several major labels and sharing major stages with many awesome bands, too many to name actually. We toured much of the continental US and around the globe on several USO tours that took us to places such as Japan, Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Singapore. It was an amazing and exciting ride, and what I most appreciated was the many positive friends that those travels brought into my life. Many of whom are still a part of my life today. As Fighting Gravity came to an end, I stepped away from the music industry for a few years in order to find a different inspiration.</p><p>However, I found myself drawn repeatedly back to the fire. The desire to get back on stage again was overwhelming. This desire led me to begin work on a life-long dream and this time I was going to do it my way and tell my story. With the help of co-writer and producer Chip Johnson of the rock band The Alternate Routes, this dream has finally come true with the Fall 2010 release of my solo CD titled My Only Secret. This music is personal. Layers were stripped away and barriers were removed and I wanted to tell a simple story of my life, my love and share it with my family and friends. It is a reflection of where I am today. It is about realizing the better side of life and those you choose to share it with. It is my hope that you will be able to draw the same inspiration from listening to the music as I have had in sharing with you.</p><p><a href=""http://www.schiavonemcgee.com/"" target=""_blank"">Shiavone Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",8255,$10 adv / $13 day of ,,1/18/11 22:30Pierce Pettis + Grace Pettis,,,7583,,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Grace Pettis is the 23-year-old daughter of Pierce Pettis, and has just released her debut, self-titled CD, Grace Pettis, with the help of Blue Rock Studio in Wimberley, TX and producer Billy Crockett.

Their already constant touring schedule recently ballooned to include touring as part of the Fred Eaglesmith Band. Backing up the iconic Indie artist led to a collaboration with Eaglesmith's band in their opening sets. Eaglesmith was struck by the new band's rough, rawboned sound and invited them to record the new Fabulous Ginn Sisters CD in his Port Dover, Ontario studio. The result is a smoky, drunken stumble through a broken-heart junkyard. &lsquo;You Can't Take a Bad Girl Home' is set for release in 2010. Having notched out a place for themselves with their amazing singing, the new CD is a marked dodge towards rock and roll. The songs are bleak yet poppy, the singing is subtle and nuanced, and the music is a garage mix of reverb and mystery hum. The Fabulous Ginn Sisters (then &lsquo;The Ginn Sisters') first made their mark on the Americana scene with their 2006 release ""Blood Oranges"" which received stellar reviews from regional, national and international media. It was played on Americana, AAA, Folk, Country, Eclectic, and even Bluegrass radio. It reached #2 on the RootsMusic Report, #3 on the FAR Chart and #24 on the Americana Chart. It was the #1 independently released CD on the Americana Chart for 2006. It was in top rotation on a number of national radio, TV-radio and Internet stations, including XM Radio's X Country. They have played in some of the best listening rooms in the country like The Ark, Mountain Stage, The Little Bear, The Bitter End, The Cactus Cafe, Eddies Attic, CSPS, the Focal Point, Swallow Hill, and the Bluebird Caf&eacute; and festivals including Big State, Kerrville, and Flat Rock.

Through a couple lineup changes, The Getaways behold the most solid roster yet: with Mike Altner at the microphone, Matt Higgins and Danial Mason weilding the axes, Brent McBride carrying the bottom end, and Austin McBride on the drums, this band embedded their distinctive synth-laden melodies into the very minds of fans and friends over the years.</p><p>Now in 2010, this group of Maryland-based rockers have accomplished and achieved more than most local bands can say, with no intention of slowing down.

culture. If you had to define their sound you would have to imagine The Beatles rapping over a punk song made by Bob Marley. Although their sound is refreshing, the most meaningful aspect behind The Five One is their concept. Revalulion [rev-uh-loo-lee-n], is the action of personifying oneself as a color, which is a philosophical term coined by the band. The members of The Five One Red, Blue, Green, and Gold, have simplified themselves from the complexities of societal identity by becoming colors. Defined only by the color in their closets, the color-coded quartet has a niche for meaningful lyrics and a sound that defies the norms of popular music. Trekking around their area now known as the DMV (Washington DC, Maryland, and Virginia), they have spread their music and mythology while sharing the stage with local acts whose genres range from Rock and Reggae to Hip-Hop and R&amp;B.</p><p><a href=""http://thefiveone.com/"" target=""_blank"">The Five One Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rock, Reggae and Hip Hop: Each is definable, recognizable and at once familiar to people the world over--but never before have those three forms of musical expression been blended into a sound that is as indefinable as it is recognizable and familiar. Enter the Philadelphia quartet known as The Movement.</p><p>Growing up with one another in Columbia, South Carolina, Joshua Swain and Jordan Miller spent time jamming in various high school bands together. Swain, a multi��_��__��_instrumentalist versed in guitar, bass, and drums, left for Florida's Full Sail University in 2001, while Miller honed his freestyle rap, guitar, and keyboard skills in Columbia. Upon returning in 2002, Swain reconnected with Miller and the two began writing songs in Swain's garage using a drum machine and drawing from musical influences that ranged from Sublime to Tupac to Pink Floyd. The Movement was born.</p><p>Early incarnations of the band found them as a trio. It was Swain, Miller and DJ Jon Ruff. They developed a loyal following as a trio and went on to release their first full length album, entitled On Your Feet. That album, recorded and mixed in 24 studio hours, was released in March of 2004 and continues to be well received by new fans worldwide.</p><p>Fast forward to 2008. The band had built a loyal following while touring the Southeastern circuit nonstop and opening for national acts such as Steel Pulse, Blues Traveler, Slightly Stoopid, The Wailers, Ludacris, G. Love &amp; Special Sauce, Common, Long Beach Shortbus, The Wu Tang Clan, 311, and Rebelution. Things were good but stale; the band wasn't breaking any new ground and the members began to lose interest. DJ Jon Ruff left the band to pursue a family while Josh and Jordan came to a crossroads. Enter producer Chris DiBeneditto (G. Love &amp; Special Sauce, Slightly Stoopid, The Expendables), who had seen the band several times and was searching for new talent to work with. The Movement quickly teamed up with him at Philadelphonic Studios in Philadelphia to begin work on what would become ""Set Sail"". It was a creative tsunami--Josh and Jordan churned out eighteen songs within a week's time. Revived by the momentum, a commitment was made to relocate to Philadelphia in order to give the project every chance to blossom. The next step was to solidify the band's roster so Chris DiBeneditto contacted local drummer Gary Jackson. After one jam session together, Gary accepted an offer to join the band and promptly suggested bassist Jay ""Smiles"" Schmidt as the missing element. It clicked right away. The vibe was on. The Movement was reborn!</p><p>The prominent new additions to the group proved their worth immediately as the live music took on a potency it had never achieved with a looped beat. The band's dedication to touring virtually nonstop since the release of Set Sail has served to establish their increasing reputation as an unmissable live show. As a further result, Set Sail has thus far attained the number 7 spot on iTunes' Top 100 Reggae Albums, brushing shoulders with the releases of long-established icons of the genre. As the fanbase booms, the crowds reach a fever pitch--but this is only the beginning--The Movement is about to Set Sail!</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/themovementvibe"" target=""_blank"">The Movement MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",7765,"$12 advance/ $15 day of show",,12/31/10 18:00Private Event,,,0,,,7391,,,12/31/10 15:004th Annual Rocknoceros New Years Eve Party,,,0,,,7957,$10 for everyone one and older,,12/30/10 0:004th Annual Rocknoceros New Years Eve Party,,,0,,,7901,$10 for everyone one and older,,12/29/10 0:00Berrett and Harrison,Cara Salimando,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eighteen year old Cara Salimando has been quietly working away at writing and performing music for almost her whole life.

Bio's are always awkward when you write them yourself, don't you agree. With That said I guess I am in need of one so I will give you a run down of my origins till now. I'm 25, and for the past hmm, I'll say 3 years I have been seriously attempting to do this music thing for a career. I decided the other day I would like to be a musician or ninja. Anyways I've released two projects ""Ced and the Technicolor Soundwave"" AND ""What Up Tho"". I signed a production deal with A dude from On Smash and Plain Pat whilst recording the latter, which didn't work out as I imagined but, a lot or good things came from it. I've done countless shows up and down the east coast all the way to TX. Never got paid much but it was definitely good times. I have opened for a bunch of acts Talib Kweli, Meth and Red, Murs, Hieroglyphics, The Pharcyde and Shwayze to name a few. Oh yea I produce as well as emcee. It helps cut out the middle man. Blah Blah Blah.. Been on a bunch of blogs, Okayplayer, 2dopeboyz, Onsmash of course, Nah Right, DiscoBelle, Palms out and so on. Right now I'm gearing up to release at least three projects in the next three months so I have been super busy. What else, I like french fries and Mountain dew amps, they are my downfall, cinnamon toast crunch is also my jam. I type how I talk and Vice Versa. I share custody of an all black cat named Jesus Alowictzh the third, we call him Jezzy for short. I'm from a small County in population but big in area called Currituck, in North Carolina. Its basically VA though were I currently reside at now. When I First started rapping it was a hobby. I wanted to go to the NBA and all that jazz. Then after I dropped out of ECU I decided I wanted to be a ""professional artist"" but not super famous. Well that changes everyday. But that is what it is. My Bio.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/cedhughes"" target=""_blank"">Ced Hughes MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JUSTi is an artist who pushes the boundaries, whether it be in his songs or in real life. His music is hip-hop with new formulas and a new attitude. JUSTi made his start as an independent promoter for a few years before he decided to roll the dice himself. When he began to make his own music, the instincts were there.</p><p>JUSTi clearly learned a few things from being around the go-go scene. His music is not considered go-go, but the energy is comparable. Through his work with producer Atom Christie, the end result is a unique breed of hip-hop, with punk and electro sensibilities.</p><p>JUSTi's first released is titled ""Fuck Your Couch.""

""But I'm not trying to be a bummer. I'm just trying to tell some stories and make music that I can get behind.""</p><p>Foul Deeds, which Young co-produced, overflows with the same richly evocative songcraft that made her self-titled 2007 debut a revelation. That album exposed the late-blooming artist as both an affecting singer and a songwriter of rare eloquence and insight. The new disc finds Young continuing to make music of uncommon warmth and gravity, delivering her lyrics of heartbreak and hard-won wisdom in understated, quietly powerful musical settings whose hushed, haunted beauty underlines the material's emotional immediacy.</p><p>""I don't write happy songs, and the songs I'm attracted to tend to be kind of melancholy,"" Young observes. ""I don't really know why that is, but that's just how they come to me, and I have to let 'em come on through.""</p><p>Pegi initially came to the public's attention through her longstanding role as backup singer with Neil Young, her husband of three decades. But Foul Deeds -- whose first 5000 copies will also include the bonus live DVD Love Like Water, directed by noted filmmaker Jonathan Demme at the Tower Theatre in Philadelphia -- makes it clear that Pegi's iconoclastic creative voice is very much her own. Her uncanny knack for cutting to the heart of thorny emotional issues drives such indelible originals as ""Broken Vows,"" ""Starting Over,"" ""Who Knew"" and the rueful title track. Another highlight is the dusky, lilting ""Traveling,"" which appears on the album in two versions, one spare and dreamy, and the other performed with a full band.</p><p>In addition to Young's own compositions, Foul Deeds features the artist's personalized interpretations of a quartet of songs by other writers. Her compelling readings of Will Jennings' ""Pleasing to Me,"" Lucinda Williams' ""Side of the Road,"" Devendra Banhart's ""Body Breaks"" and B. Boatman's ""Blue Sunday"" imbue those already-distinctive songs with additional depth and color.</p><p>""I'm still a big believer in the old idea of a record being a complete experience,"" Young asserts. ""So it matters to me that the songs have thematic relevance, and that somehow it tells some kind of story. Maybe people don't really listen to records as a whole anymore, and you can work on the sequencing till the cows come home but they'll still put it on shuffle and it doesn't matter. But it matters to me, and this group of songs just seem to make sense together.""</p><p>Foul Deeds reteams Young with the group of veteran musicians and longtime friends whose sensitivity and rapport helped to distinguish her debut effort. Multi-instrumentalist Ben Keith (who co-produced the album with Young), guitarist/harmony singer Anthony Crawford and bassist Rick Rosas, who comprised Young's live band while touring behind her debut, were joined on the sessions by drummer Phil Jones, whose resume includes work with Tom Petty and Bob Dylan. Elsewhere on Foul Deeds, Neil Young plays guitar on three tracks, which also feature legendary keyboardist Spooner Oldham and noted session drummer Karl Himmel.</p><p>Pegi Young began writing songs and playing guitar while still in high school, but eventually put her creative instincts on hold to attend to the demands of family life. Pegi and Neil's experiences caring for their son Ben, who was born with cerebral palsy, led Pegi to co-found the non-profit Bridge School, whose innovative methods of aiding children with severe speech and physical impairments have established the school as a leader in its field over the past 25 years. Pegi and Neil have also been the forces behind the annual all-star Bridge School Benefit concerts, and Pegi continues to serve as president of the school's Board of Directors.</p><p>Pegi found herself drawn towards music again after she began touring as backup singer with her husband's band beginning in 2000. With her kids grown and the confidence gained from performing numerous live shows, she finally had the time and focus to begin recording her own songs.</p><p>""When I was younger, I was way, way too shy to do anything but very amateur performing,"" Young states. ""But it eventually became a matter of having these opportunities and building some confidence and thinking, do I really want to be on my deathbed going 'Damn, I wish I'd made some records'? So I did it, and I loved it. And then I had more songs, so I did it again.""</p><p>Having gained further experience from making her first album and touring extensively to support it, she took a more hands-on role in Foul Deeds' recording process.</p><p>""I did end up taking more of a leadership role this time,"" Young notes. ""The whole project felt a lot less tentative and more focused, just because I'd done it already. It all came together very quickly. We'd been on the road so much that we were all pretty in sync, and adding Phil on drums had really opened things up, so I just thought, we had to get some of this on tape. We pulled it together very spontaneously, and recorded for three or four days, and everything kind of came together.""</p><p>With a pair of personally charged, deeply felt albums under her belt, Pegi Young is embracing music-making with passion and pragmatism.</p><p>""I'm 57, so I'm never gonna be the next big thing, but I'm cool with that,"" she concludes. ""If I was younger, I might be more focused on the commerce part of it. But I'm not a 20-year-old trying to make a living, so I don't have to conform to some record company's idea of whatever they're looking for that week. In that way, I guess I can be truly independent and focus on the creative part. I have no idea where it will go from here, but I'm having fun and I feel really, really good about what I've done so far.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.pegiyoung.com/"" target=""_blank"">Pegi Young Website</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",7434,$20 ,,12/11/10 21:00XYRA + MYSTIC ANGELS...

Despite only officially forming just over a year ago and signing to Fearless Records in spring 2010, the Orlando, FL quartet has already made an impact on the pop rock scene, gaining a rapidly-expanding following both in the U.S. and beyond. With their debut EP Hello World, the band has created the perfect introduction to their sound - melodic, infectious... and about to get fans across the world addicted.</p><p>Amely began as a studio project for lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist Petie Pizarro, who began writing songs that had so much potential, he decided to record an EP, On My Own, at Vision Sound Studios in Jacksonville, Florida, with producer Daryl Phennager (Red Jumpsuit Apparatus). Impressively, Pizarro played all the instruments on the recording, including guitar, bass, piano and synths.</p><p>Bringing in Nate Parsell in to record drums, the pair completed the EP in June 2008. ""For a couple of years I had been writing songs for Amely while I was with my old band,"" notes Pizarro. ""When we finally recorded them and got the mixes back, we knew that we had to put all of our energy into making ""Amely"" more than just a project."" Pizarro and Parsell set about forming a band, completing the line up with Patrick Ridgen on bass, and guitarist Brandon Walden. Amely was born.</p><p>Produced by Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount (All Time Low, Mayday Parade, Cartel) and Mike Green (Paramore, Breathe Carolina), Amely's debut EP Hello World is a bouncy blend of spirited rock spiked with a healthy dose of power-pop influence. Wishing to create a sound with mass appeal, not pinned down by a single genre, the band has created eight timeless tracks in the vein of pop-rock dynamos such as All American Rejects and Jimmy Eat World, that defiantly refuses to adhere to any age range, gender or mindset restrictions. ""We want to be a mature pop/rock band with a sound that kids can get into, but adults will also enjoy,"" notes Pizarro. ""The four of us have grown together so much in the past year and a half, not only personally but musically as well, and we think it truly shows in the new EP.""</p><p>Get ready to be charmed by the sweet sounds of Amely, one of pop rock's newest and most promising acts.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/amely"" target=""_blank"">Amely MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",7276,$10 ,,12/5/10 19:00Our Daily Bread Presents Dave LaMotte,Christopher Williams,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.<br /></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hailing from Nashville, but nothing like your typical Nashville songwriter, Christopher Williams is a songwriter, storyteller, and entertainer - offering songs that are honest and confessional, yet never overbearing; and performances that engage audiences with an appealing mix of intense passion and humor.  With lush guitar work, and sweet soaring vocals, (Boston Phoenix) punctuated by the percussive vulnerability of a single African djembe hand drum, Williams is a hard-touring singer-songwriter and a master at spreading his personal energy out into a live audience. (Madison Isthmus) Touring nonstop nationally for the last ten years at a pace of more than 130 shows a year, Williams has built a faithful following of listeners around the country and is a true independent artist, releasing eight records on his own label. He has toured with Grammy Award winning band Jars of Clay, opening for, as well as playing percussion with (including their mainstage performance at the incredible Live 8 concert in Philadelphia).

Recently, he had the opportunity to contribute music to a USAID documentary film and attend the sponsored screening with the former First Lady, Laura Bush, in Washington, DC, and also play the International Justice Mission 10th Anniversary Banquet. His latest release is a new live recording, called 'Something As Simple,' that features the honesty of a true live performance with stories, the signature djembe playing and his unique guitar style.

That's probably the first thing you thought to yourself when you came across this Rock/Reggae band from Northern Virginia. When the band first came together in March of 2008, it was just a random assortment of words they would say to each other. After putting together an arsenal of catchy tunes and playing 100's of hard-hitting live performances, the name has evolved into many different meanings. The band's music promotes a strong community, individual strength, good times, and lessons learned. Bass player Corey Sullivan shares, ""Feed God Cabbage means whatever you want it to. But if you ask me, it means that people shouldn't take life so seriously. Sit back and enjoy the ride. Just take it easy when you have the opportunity. Life's short, live it up.""</p><p>Emerging from Springfield VA, Feed God Cabbage is raising the bar and setting the pace in the local DMV music scene. In May of 2009, they released their first CD titled ""We the People."" The compilation of music is a great taste of the upbeat reggae style, heavy guitar riffs, smooth bass lines, and meaningful lyrics that the band produces. After launching the physical CD, the EP was posted on all major download sites including iTunes and CDbaby.</p><p>What has really made this band gain recognition is their incredible on-stage live performances at local venues like State Theatre, Fat Tuesdays, JAXX, and Jammin Java. Many are impressed by the multi-talents of Dylan Sajbel, who is the drummer and the lead singer. The band has also had great success at the many state colleges of Virginia including JMU, Virginia Tech, George Mason, VCU, and Radford. Guitar player Aaron March commented, ""You can't beat playing a show onstage in front of a sold out crowd. But some of my favorite shows are the house parties. We always end up having a good time because we get to party along with our fans.""</p><p>Only after a year since they released their first demo, Feed God Cabbage has begun to open for established local bands and national acts like SOJA, Ballyhoo, HR, Mike Pinto, and Murphy's Kids. It's amazing how this band has evolved from a party band, to a fully fledged professional rock band. The talents of this young ensemble continue to emerge with every performance. Come out and see the band that everyone in the DMV area is raving about!

They play a fusion of progressive and classic rock styles, which has been enthusiastically received by audiences in clubs and music festivals. They have just completed recording a set of new original songs that can be heard on their MySpace site and in their electronic press kit on Sonicbids. The band is composed of veteran musicians who have backed up great acts like the Pointer Sisters and Procol Harum. Their most recent appearances were at the JAXX Night Club in West Springfield, Virginia, the Fairfax Corner Summer Concert Series and the Reston Summer Festival in Virginia. Their music is a unique blend of contemporary and classic styles, similar to such progressive rock artists as Snow Patrol, Linkin Park, Creed, Santana and Porcupine Tree. In selective club venues, in addition to originals songs, the band is capable of playing a fusion style of blues/jazz/rock music by such artists as Steve Kimock and Rodney Holmes. For outdoor festivals they add to their repertoire of original music classic rock hits from such artists as The Allman Brothers Band, Led Zeppelin and The Moody Blues. This ability to appeal to old and young audiences alike sets Satellite Papa apart at big music festival events, where they have been enthusiastically received by large audiences. They were runner ups in a ""battle of the bands"" at JAXX club last year.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/satellitepapa1"" target=""_blank"">Satellite Papa MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",7531,$8 advance (available through Afton Shows ONLY)/ $12 at the door,,11/21/10 1:00Caravan Of Thieves,Chester River Runoff,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.reverbnation.com/chesterriverrunoff"" target=""_blank"">Chester River Runoff Website</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",7488,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,11/20/10 0:00Private Event,,,0,,,7386,,,11/18/10 23:30Daniel Lanois��_��__��_ Black Dub,Rocco Deluca,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>""Walking the fine line between Americana revival and commercial success, Rocco Deluca's Mississippi Delta originates from Southern California's swagger and sunshine."" <em>-Matt Elder, Filter</em></p><p>""Rocco has his feet on the ground and his eyes to the sky,"" says Daniel Lanois, five-time Grammy-winning producer, who produced Rocco's sophomore effort, ""Mercy"" (Universal/Republic/IW).</p><p>Rocco grew up in Southern California, honing both his slide guitar and distinctive falsetto vocals in the clubs of Orange County and Los Angeles.

Listen to his music, and you too won't deny his gift for sweet melodies and moving narratives that stick in your head like happy memories. His songs have a maturity you wouldn't expect from a young twenty-something who is quickly emerging as one of the best of a new generation of pop-rock songwriters who call Nashville home.

What inspired their music? Perhaps it was their attendance of the 2009 Vans Warped Tour...or, just like the story that is continually told, a hummingbird flying by on a summer day invoked the muse in all of them.</p><p>Nonetheless, contributing each of their talents and creative ingenuity, they establish a sweet rock sound that sometimes takes a darker edge. Their influences? There are many, such as The Cranberries, Meg &amp; Dia, and Vedera, who inspire their sound, but others such as Muse, The Cure, and Hotspur who inspire them to make music. In addition, each member also has her own influences who inspire her as a musician.</p><p>While the band has been together for only over a year, their hard work and dedication have allowed them to perform at venues such as DAR Constitution Hall, the D.C. Armory, 9:30 Club, University of Maryland's Byrd Stadium and in cities such as Toronto, ON and New York City. They were the 2010 1st place winners of the Quest Battle of the Bands in Damascus, MD, 2010 2nd place winners of the Next Big Thing Tour Battle of the Bands at the 9:30 club in D.C., and won UMD's SEE 2010 Battle of the Bands which earned them the opening spot at UMD's Art Attack XXVII where they opened for Ben Folds and Weezer.</p><p>Ivy Rose released their debut CD ""This Adventure"" last Aug. 2010 and is available in iTunes.</p><p><a href=""http://www.ivyrosemusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Ivy Rose Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The music from Fight the Lion is the sound of bold defiance.  Everybody has a lion in their life - something stalking you, watching you, waiting for a moment of weakness to pounce.  Maybe your lion keeps you awake at night, or drives you crazy during the day.  Whatever it is, the lion hunts for an opportunity to take you down.<br /> <br />Fight the Lion's music begins at exactly this moment.  Our songs are about turning your fear and weakness into confrontation and courage.  When you find yourself surrounded by enemies, Fight the Lion is the sound of victory.<br /> <br />All the members of Fight the Lion bring strength to the sound of Fight the Lion. From Jake's soaring vocals in ""Don't Runaway,"" to Ron's guitar wizardry in ""Fire It Up!"", from Shawn's arresting rhythms in ""Let This Die"", to Jason's guard-dog-on-a-chain ferocity in ""Longshot"", these guys are on a mission of rock and roll vengeance. They bring that mission to the stage with a frenetic energy. And when it seems that they've lost control, that you're about to witness unhinged chaos, they execute perfect musical transitions that punctuate the thunder with silence and empty space.</p><p>On their debut full length album, ""When the Mighty Fall,"" Fight the Lion transitions from the title track's epic ballad to the full-throttle rock of ""Fire it Up"". With songs like ""Let This Die"" and ""A New Hope"", they paint a textured musical scene with complex harmonies and rhythms. If that's a little too heavy, ""Don't Runaway"" and ""The Drive"" score big with an Americana-rock sound and irresistible vocals. And if it's not heavy enough, ""Longshot"" hits like a savage punch to the gut. Fight the Lion crosses multiple genres, but always delivers killer melodies, masterful guitar work, and flawless rhythms.</p><p>""Fight the Lion's sound is cut for radio. Their grinding guitar licks, and dark minor-driven verses that swing into soaring choruses bring to mind the likes of Chevelle, Tool, Hoobastank, and other bands you might hear when flipping your dial to DC101 (or the late great HFS). The album leaves little doubt that lead singer Jake Mimikos and his crew are talented, and the production of this disc is far beyond what one would expect from a band at such an early stage in their career. The title track ""When the Mighty Fall"" is a notable piece in the project, evoking an early-nineties rock sound reminiscent of Soundgarden, and ""A New Hope"" drips with the syncopated guitar riffs connoisseurs of this genre drool over. For fans of the modern rock genre, this band is absolutely for you, buy the album, I promise you will love it."" <em>-DM, OnTap Magazine</em><br /> <br />""The tunes on When the Mighty Fall should fit right in with that lineup. Fourth track ""Fire It Up!"" absolutely owns a ""Rocky"" anthem, get-on-your-feet-and-scream quality.The album eases into its ultimate electric-storm vibe with ""A New Hope,"" an A Perfect Circle-like track with a skulking verse and a burgeoning chorus that shows off Mimikos's pipes and Battle's hardcore harmonies. ""Let This Die"" follows, with more vocal gymnastics and a raucous and robust chorus."" <em>-Mike Hume, Falls Church News-Press</em><br /> <br />""Just when I thought real rock music was dead, Fight The Lion infested my speakers. Very impressive arrangements and writing supported by aggressive drums. It's one of the few CD's that doesn't leave my car. It's perfect for driving or preparing for MMA training. Hey, Fight The Lion!"" <em>-Ed Norris, The Ed Norris Show 105.7 THE FAN</em></p><p>The band seems to be defining their sound on this CD. Tracks seem to bounce back and forth between uptempo rockers such as ""Runaway Lover"" and ""The Drive"" to slower, more emotionally charged songs such as ""A New Hope"" and ""The Changing"". You can really feel the emotional attachment to the lyrics of the slower songs by Jake. The title track, ""When The Mighty Fall"" is a standout on the CD and sets the tone of the overall positive message that the band is conveying to the listener, focusing on the positive and overcoming negativity."" <em>-Johnny Price, ""I LOVE MUSIC!!!!!!!""</em></p><p><a href=""http://www.fightthelion.com/"" target=""_blank"">Fight The Lion Website</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",7161,$10 ,,10/30/10 2:30HAITI BENEFIT featuring Jack Tierney + Emmy Day,Iona Sound,,7127,,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Come out to support Haiti and see local bands this October 30th, featuring artists such as Jack Tierney and Emmy Day, with more TBA.

STAND UNDER NONE. ""I think the suns comin' out"", says 22 year old Dylan Smith. He is positive his positivity will bring him something positive. ""The two things I base my life around and continue to stay passionate about are music and ""the secret"". I know that thinking about what you want will bring you.....what you want. I know what I want and I know i'm going to get what I want. Once I figured that out there wasn't much to be unhappy about. I'm not even kidding when i say....i'm always happy, and people really seem to notice that. Some literally tell me that I make them feel better just being around...there's really not much better of a compliment than that. With my music I take that feeling and turn it into a sound. I know i could write ""break up"" songs, or ""the worlds got me down"" songs but I honestly don't think about those things. I ONLY think happy thoughts.....and i can promise you, it works."" Dylan has been pursuing music at a serious level since age 14. ""My first instrument was a Fender strat my dad got me for christmas when i was 9. I didn't really know anything about music at that point so the guitar didn't interest me much. I'm totally serious when i say this.....the band ""HANSON"" gets full credit for getting me into music. I grew up with an older sister, and I just remember all her friends coming over and going crazy over these dudes. Zac Hanson (the drummer) seemed to get the most girls so naturally...i chose to play drums. From that moment on, all I wanted to do was play music and tour. I played in a bunch of bands growing up (the semester, sideline heroes...) and then joined ""Four Letter Lie"". We were signed by the time I was 18 and did nothing but tour. I love drums but I always wanted to interact with the crowd more. While touring I started to freestyle, I'm a funny dude so making people laugh wasn't ever a problem. I could go on forever just rhymin about whatever was in front of me. People started tellin me to record some tracks and the rest is history.""</p><p>MOD SUN released his first cd (a full-length) titled, ""I'll Buy Myself"", on January 31st 2009. It featured 11 songs, all of which were original beats made by MOD SUN himself. The songs were written and recorded over a 8 month span from May to December 2008. Every song was recorded in his bedroom and produced by him and only him.

It features 11 brilliant new songs including the heavily loved track, ""No Girlfriend"". It's got party-anthems, dreams-come-true songs, get high tracks, and really just captures that ""the suns out!"" vibe.</p><p>MOD SUN recently released his second free mixtape ""How To Make A MOD SUN"". It includes 17 new original songs and remixes. H2MAMS paints the picture of his thoughts about growing up and teaches you the steps it took to get to where he currently stands today.

I take my word very seriously.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/modsun"" target=""_blank"">Mod Sun MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since 2006, Stereo Skyline have released an EP, been a mainstay at The Bamboozle festivals and been touted as on of Alternative Press' ""100 Bands You Need to Know in 2010."" The Long Island, N.Y. natives, who are not even old enough to drink, have also shared the stage with the likes of Hanson, Cartel, All Time Low and Boys Like Girls, and been a part of the Take Action Tour and Bamboozle Roadshow. Now, after four years of mounting accomplishments, Stereo Skyline is ready to release their highly anticipated debut album, Stuck On Repeat, on July 20, 2010.</p><p>Formed while its members were still in high school, the high-energy pop/rock four-piece experienced several changes before settling with its current lineup. ""We were just having fun,"" lead singer Kevin Bard explains ""We weren't very serious about it, but when we decided we wanted to do it for a living, people who didn't want to left, and whoever was serious stayed.""</p><p>The band released their self-titled EP in 2008, but Stereo Skyline says they've completely changed as a band. ""I feel like we've all grown up and matured naturally,"" bassist Brian Maddox says. ""We feel like this is who we are, this is what we write and this is what we want to be doing. I think it takes a little bit of time to find that, but we've all really come into our own with it.""</p><p>""I think as we've gotten more mature with writing music, we've realized that a good song is a good song,"" Bard adds. ""It doesn't have to be something crazy different. Good pop is one of the rarest things you can find, and I think that's what we're all aiming for.""</p><p>To enhance the band's pop instincts, the group worked with a variety of songwriters and producers on Stuck On Repeat, including S*A*M and Sluggo, Metro Station's Blake Healy and Fountains of Wayne's Adam Schlesinger. Recorded in both New York City and Los Angeles, the album is a compilation of collaborations, which as the title denotes, get stuck on repeat in your head.</p><p>The album title is also a lyric from the band's first single, ""Tongue Tied"" (co-written by Healy), which is about a guy who's apprehensive about talking to a girl he sees from afar. ""The scenario has probably happened to every single person in the world,"" Bard says. ""They see somebody and are like [gasp], but they don't actually go over but they wish they did."" The band also gets a little help on the single from their friend Cassadee Pope, lead singer of Hey Monday. Although audiences won't hear her sing, the 20-year-old does lend her voice to a part of ""Tongue Tied"" that involves a phone call between a guy and a girl.</p><p>One of the best examples of Stereo Skyline's innate pop sensibility is their song ""Heartbeat,"" which was released on their self-titled EP and re-recorded for Stuck On Repeat. The song was written by Bard when he was just 15 years old, at an age when he humbly says the band ""didn't know how to make pop music, or any music rather."" However, the infectious single remains Stereo Skyline's most recognizable song and fan favorite.</p><p>Although Stereo Skyline is poised for greatness, the band has modest goals. ""We want to take over the world,"" drummer Rob Michaelsen teases. ""Actually, a personal goal of mine is to hear myself on the radio, so hopefully some of these songs can make that happen for us."" Maddox, however, has a more philosophical perspective on everything that has led to this moment, and all that's in store. ""I think people are going to be very impressed with this record, and to see what our songs have transformed into,"" he says. ""It was a long road to get us to this point, to release our first record, but I think it was necessary, and now we're actually ready for it.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/stereoskyline"" target=""_blank"">Stereo Skyline MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",7164,$12 ,,10/25/10 23:00Parachute,Hot Chelle Rae,,0,Joe Brooks,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.joebrooks.com"" target=""_blank"">Joe Brooks Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hot Chelle Rae announce themselves as a force to be reckoned with on their debut album Lovesick Electric. How can you argue with bold, swaggering vocals, monster sing-along choruses, crunching rock guitar, and a propulsive rhythm section that just won't quit?</p><p>""We wanted the music to sound larger than life,"" says guitarist Nash Overstreet of the group's epic dance-rock sound. ""We wanted it to sound explosive and new and fun and be better than anything out there,"" adds frontman Ryan Keith Follese. Indeed, stomping, blistering jams like ""I Like to Dance,"" ""Never Have I Ever,"" ""Say (Half Past Nine),"" and ""Bushes,"" will sound equally fierce whether they're blasting from a car stereo or emanating from an arena stage.</p><p>As one reviewer has already raved about the Nashville newcomers: ""Hot Chelle Rae are honest to goodness rock and roll at its finest - ripe and arrogant, sweating with tangible promise that hangs in the air at their live shows. Posh arrangements featuring refreshingly tasteful guitar, sly lyrics, and a 22-year-old lead singer dripping with charisma, leave you knowing that these guys will end up somewhere-everywhere.""</p><p>High praise, but not surprising considering that all four band members were raised with music in their DNA. Ryan, his brother/drummer Jamie, and Overstreet are the sons of A- list Nashville songwriters with multiple number one hits between them, while bassist Ian Keaggy's dad is a world renowned Grammy-nominated guitarist.</p><p>""Growing up around music didn't hurt, but I was never pushed to do it,"" Overstreet says. ""I just can't remember a time when I didn't want to play or write music."" Follese says his father actually encouraged him not to go into the music business. ""But I don't know what else I can do,"" he says. ""Music is the only thing I truly have a passion for.""</p><p>And so the guys claimed their destiny by forming Hot Chelle Rae, which they named after one of the group's most devoted female fans. The band began to take shape in early 2005 when a mutual friend recommended that Overstreet and Follese meet. Follese was doing what he calls ""the singer-songwriter thing"" and was looking for a guitar player. But their first meeting didn't go too smoothly. ""We definitely didn't like each other,"" Follese says. ""We dressed differently. I was clean-cut and Nash wasn't. We looked like polar opposites, and it was just, like, no."" But the two managed to overcome their initial impressions and form their first band, which they called Miracle Drug. When their first show in August 2006 went well, they decided to try writing songs together and ""we just clicked right away,"" Follese says.</p><p>They brought in Nash's childhood friend Ian Keaggy - a guitarist who didn't even play bass until he joined the band. ""Ian came to one of our shows where we had a hired gun on bass and he said, &lsquo;If that guy can play bass, I can play bass,'"" Follese recalls. ""And that was that. He makes up the most creative stuff. We've written so many songs that have started with his bass riffs."" Ryan's brother Jamie joined up soon after. ""At first we weren't sure because he was young, but we had a couple rehearsals with him and he knew every song because he'd been playing them for ages,"" Follese says. ""Anything Nash and I wrote, even if we hadn't recorded it, he knew it. He's a human metronome. He just stepped in and sat down and was like, &lsquo;I know these songs.'""</p><p>At this point, Hot Chelle Rae had already been taken under the wing of entertainment exec John Hamlin, who signed them up for management. Hamlin then teamed up with music industry vet Don Ienner who guided them toward a deal with Jive Records. After signing with the label in October 2008, the guys began to gear up to make their first album, sorting through dozens of songs they had already written. ""My dad told me early on that writing hit songs is just like your batting average,"" Follese says. ""He reminded me that Barry Bonds hits 70 homeruns a year, but he doesn't hit a homerun every time - it's maybe one out of ten. So if you want to write hit songs, you're going to have to write 50 songs for your first record,' which is what we did. We threw out loads of songs.""</p><p>To help them narrow it down, the band took advice from two of their producers, Eric Valentine and Butch Walker, both of whom know a little something about serving up hit albums. Valentine, who produced five tracks including ""Say"" and ""I Like to Dance,"" has worked with All-American Rejects and Good Charlotte, while artist/producer Butch Walker, who produced two tracks, ""The Distance"" and ""Bushes,"" has worked with Katy Perry, Avril Lavigne, and Pink. ""I don't know if there's a guy on earth more driven to make something sound the best that it can sound than Eric,"" Follese says. ""He is obsessive and only produces songs that he truly connects with, which is really cool."" ""And Butch Walker is someone we've always really looked up to and have wanted to work with for a long time,"" adds Overstreet. ""When we were trying to decide who should produce the record, we figured why not shoot high? There's so much passion and power in everything he puts to tape, he really helped us get that across.""</p><p>Lovesick Electric brims with the confidence and youthful energy that only a group of musicians with serious chops can deliver. ""I think the album really reflects who we are and how we want the world to feel,"" Overstreet says. ""We can have a lot of fun and goof off, or we can be very serious and work really hard, and the album shows it all. We've got songs for people to listen to if they're going through a break-up, like &lsquo;The Distance' or &lsquo;Last One Standing,' or if they want to just forget about work, like &lsquo;I Like to Dance,' or they want to dream about the future, like &lsquo;Say.' We've tried hard to make it completely accessible and something people can really relate to no matter what's going on in their lives.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.hotchellerae.com/"" target=""_blank"">Hot Chelle Rae Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",7354,$15 ,,10/24/10 23:30Kyle Patrick (from The Click Five),Alexis Babini,Sing Me Insomnia (Acoustic),0,Lady Danville,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/singmeinsomnia"" target=""_blank"">Sing Me Insomnia (Acoustic) MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/ladydanville"" target=""_blank"">Lady Danville MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With a staggering amount of new music and tour dates, alternative pop songwriter Alexis Babini has been extremely busy.

Upon the release of the EP, Alexis hit the road, sharing the stage with established acts such as Blues Traveler, Boz Scaggs, Ken Block (of Sister Hazel) and Benjy Davis Project.</p><p>In March of 2010, two of Alexis' songs were featured in an episode MTV's ""Real World DC"", which led to a performance at the legendary SXSW festival in Austin, TX.

And that notion of exploration, of following the path of the unexpected, has been a constant force in his career as a musician. Smith has transcended traditional singer-songwriter boundaries and over the past 25 years has assembled a varied, fascinating musical legacy as fulfilling to his listeners as it has been to himself.</p><p>His 10 critically acclaimed studio albums, recorded from New York to Nashville and London to Los Angeles, weave together rock, pop, country, folk and Americana influences with the musical roots of his home state of Texas. Based in Austin since 1982, Smith, praised by All Music Guide as ""a singer-songwriter blessed with an uncommon degree of intelligence, depth, and compassion,"" has created a distinctive, admired body of work and has long enjoyed an international following as a compelling live performer.</p><p>Beyond his foundation as a singer-songwriter, Smith has, among other things, composed an orchestral piece for the Austin Symphony, written and produced a documentary for BBC Radio 2, scored compositions for experimental dance troupes and created a dramatic song cycle for a theatre production now underway. And his ""Be An Artist Program,"" which he founded in 2003, is a popular series of in-school workshops that seek to foster creativity in students across the United States and Western Europe.</p><p>His most recent release, After All This Time: The Best of Darden Smith, is an enchanting 16-song collection chronicling what No Depression called ""the restless stylistic evolution"" of ""an artist beyond category."" It neatly encapsulates Smith's distinguished career with selections from every one of his studio albums, plus two new tracks. The debut release on his own Darden Music label, After All This Time draws its title from his 2002 No. 3 single on the BBC Radio 2 chart. It includes his 1993 hits ""Loving Arms"" and ""Little Victories"" as well as ""Reminds Me (A Little of You)"" from Evidence, his acclaimed 1989 collaboration with the British singer-songwriter Boo Hewerdine.</p><p>""Sierra Diablo"" is a new track included as a preview from Smith's upcoming album Marathon, which is scheduled to be released in the spring of 2010 and promises another stylistic shift from his most recent work. Also included is ""Dying' To Be Born Again,"" a new honky-tonk, gospel-twanged piece recorded in 2009 with Harlem Parlour Music Club, which ""brings me back around full-circle to roots music, where I started,"" Smith said.</p><p>Growing up in rural Texas in the 1960s and 1970s instilled in Smith a driven, independent creative vision. Born in Brenham in 1962, Smith spent his early childhood on a farm outside of the small town in central Texas. ""I grew up in the country playing by myself and walking around everywhere,"" he said. He credits those hours wandering through nearby fields and woods ""for giving me an imagination and a gift for making up stories."" Singing in his local church's choir, and listening to its pipe organ, sparked a hunger to connect with music, and by the third grade Smith was learning to play the guitar. His guitar teacher taught him how to play every song on Neil Young's Harvest and After the Gold Rush albums, and, more importantly, instilled in him the idea of writing his own songs. He wrote his first song when he was 10 years old.</p><p>When his family moved to the suburbs of Houston when he was a teenager, Smith took refuge from his unfamiliar world by studying the songs of Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt and John Prine, and by writing songs of his own. He was soon slipping into Houston clubs to watch established singer-songwriters perform, and by the time he went on to graduate from the University of Texas in 1985, Smith was making his own mark as a regular performer on the Austin and Texas music scenes.</p><p>He released his debut album, Native Soil, in 1986, featuring fellow Texans Lyle Lovett and Nanci Griffith on harmony vocals and earning accolades from All Music Guide as ""a gem."" The Nashville division of Epic Records signed Smith soon after, and his 1988 album Darden Smith produced two country chart hit singles, ""Little Maggie"" and ""Day After Tomorrow."" Evidence, his 1989 Chrysalis Records duet album with Boo Hewerdine of The Bible, earned a glowing 3&frac12;-star review from Rolling Stone, and Smith's projectory expanded beyond the country music scene.</p><p>His major label deal with Epic was transferred to the pop division of Columbia Records, yielding Trouble No More in 1990 and, three years later, Little Victories, which included his pop hit single, ""Loving Arms."" He went on to release on independent labels Deep Fantastic Blue (1996) and Extra Extra (2000).</p><p>A stylistic trilogy of lauded albums from Dualtone Music Group followed: Sunflower (2002), which included the hit ""After All This Time"" and was praised by All Music Guide as ""mature, passionate and thoughtful""; Circo (2004); and Field of Crows (2005), described by Harp as ""a mesmerizing set of songs with a musical and emotional richness that so many other singer-songwriters only strive for."" In 2007 Smith issued Ojo, a limited-edition recording from a series of live concerts in New Mexico.</p><p>An enthusiasm for creative exploration has led Smith to develop unusual pairings within his career as a singer-songwriter. He was the first local artist commissioned to create a work for the Austin Symphony, yielding ""Grand Motion"" in 1999, and his 2006 documentary for BBC Radio 2, ""Songs from the Big Sky,"" skillfully explored the relationship between renowned Texas songwriters and the landscape of the Lone Star State. And his most recent venture has unfolded with Marathon, a dramatic song cycle matching 10 mesmerizing works onstage with a storyline based on Norwegian mythology.</p><p>Smith's nonprofit ""Be An Artist Program"" (www.be-an-artist.com) has melded his interests in music, education and community involvement into an innovative program that uses songwriting to encourage students to explore creativity in a way not usually seen in traditional school classrooms.  In doing so, Smith has forged ""another career that has nothing to do with the music business, but it's still music and art,"" he says. ""I like working in that big context and doing different things.""</p><p>Even as Smith celebrates his 25th year as a professional musician with After All This Time: The Best of Darden Smith, there's no doubt that new ventures are ahead. For him, being a musician has always been about answering the question, ""I've done that, now can I do this?"" He gratefully credits his co-writers, producers and fellow musicians with fueling and supporting his creative path, and for nurturing his own artistic muse. ""I'm more excited about music now than I've ever been,"" Smith says. ""And there's no end to it.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.dardensmith.com/"" target=""_blank"">Darden Smith Website</a><em><br /></em></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",7011,$20 advance/ $25 day of show,,10/19/10 23:30Jill Sobule,Amber Rubarth and Adam Levy,,0,Andi Almqvist,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/andialmqvist"" target=""_blank"">Andi Almqvist MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Amber Rubarth's musings on life are delightful in their innocence with a depth wise beyond her years.

He has spent the last four years since moving to New York engineering and mixing his own fully produced demo versions of over forty-five original songs at his home studio, eleven of which will appear on his debut full length album, Fast Asleep But Running, due out this fall. For the new album Tejas and the band went into Brooklyn's Excello Recordings to work with producer/engineer Hugh Pool, whose credits include The National's 2003 album, Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers. Mixed by Serge Tsai (Wyclef Jean, Jimmy Cliff, Shakira) at New York's Platinum Sounds, the album demonstrates Tejas' versatility as a songwriter, and his ability to produce rock/pop music that has something relevant to say.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/tejassingh"" target=""_blank"">Tejas Singh MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",7238,$15 ,,10/14/10 0:00David Choi,,,0,,"<p><strong>EARLY SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",7173,$12 advance/ $15 day of show,,10/12/10 23:30The Sweetback Sisters,Tommy Rueckert,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tommy Rueckert has been playing in the DC area for many years, with various songs featured on Mary Cliff's ""Traditions"" show on PBS and on Dick Cerri's Music Americana Showcase.

If you had to define their sound you would have to imagine The Beatles rapping over a punk song made by Bob Marley. Although their sound is refreshing, the most meaningful aspect behind The Five One is their concept. Revalulion [rev-uh-loo-lee-n], is the action of personifying oneself as a color, which is a philosophical term coined by the band. The members of The Five One Red, Blue, Green, and Gold, have simplified themselves from the complexities of societal identity by becoming colors. Defined only by the color in their closets, the color-coded quartet has a niche for meaningful lyrics and a sound that defies the norms of popular music. Trekking around their area now known as the DMV (Washington DC, Maryland, and Virginia), they have spread their music and mythology while sharing the stage with local acts whose genres range from Rock and Reggae to Hip-Hop and R&amp;B. In the summer of 2008 the band played the Afro Punk Festival in Brooklyn, New York joining an eclectic blend of artists such as Janelle Monae, Saul Williams, and Murs. The Five One has always been able to naturally integrate into any music scene or genre. Entering MTV's Dewcircuit Breakout Contest, they obtained national exposure with their song ""Active"" on MTV2, side-by-side various rock acts across the nation. With the emergence of niche music blogs, the band gained a lot of attention on the internet through rearranging songs of various artists such as Bob Marley, Lykke Li, N*E*R*D, Gorillaz, Zero 7, Vampire Weekend, Kanye West, and many more. With songs like ""District of Colossus"" and ""What Sarah Said"" The Five One grants listeners a sample of their approach by creating songs that deliver intellectually, as well as providing infectious choruses and melodies. This remix project has accrued over 40,000 downloads, and individual songs and videos have been covered on various sites such as MTVU, USAToday, Chicago Now (Gowherehiphop) and Washington Post. Meeting in Reston, Virginia The Five One has recorded all of their music themselves, in a basement filled with guitars; a drum set, a few microphones, and looped-based recording software. As studio artists their explorations in music are focused on pushing boundaries Implementing samples and loops with live instrumentation. Percussion on their songs sometimes will be a drum kit and other times a chair or bang of a skateboard. Their live show is treated as an opportunity to re-engineer the material into a surprising new form with Red playing guitar, Blue on the drums, Green on keys, and Gold on bass. The Five One's songs deliver a real message in color that will inspire those who take the long and winding road to freedom.</p><p><a href=""http://thefiveone.com/"" target=""_blank"">The Five One Website</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",7053,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,10/9/10 2:00Buskin & Batteau,David Glaser,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.davidglaser.com/"" target=""_blank"">David Glaser Website</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",7099,$20 ,,10/8/10 23:00Tyrone Wells,Andrew Belle,,0,Crown Point,"<p><strong>LATE SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""color: #800000;""><strong>$22 VIP tickets can be purchased by clicking <a href=""http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/add_cart.asp?out=1&amp;quick=1&amp;item_id=893"" target=""_self"">HERE</a>.

Like the gloriously disorganized life he observed in his former neighborhood, his songs usually aren't about linear expectations or predictable narratives, they are flashes of emotion, snapshots of time reassembled in his songs with rhyme and melody to make uncommon, musical sense.</p><p>He carried most of the songs from Houston to his new home in Nashville, finishing out a few of them with co-writers like Will Kimbrough, Kim Richey and R.S Field, a first for the previously lone writer. The songs on his new album Bucket, are still populated with life's losers, soul-searchers, and dreamers - the kind songwriting that won him praise for his more acoustic-tinged debut, Watertown. But this time, he leaves the Texas imagery behind.</p><p>For his second album Mando distanced himself musically and thematically from his past. Partnered with some of roots-rock's most potent musicians - Kenny Vaughn, Richard Bennett, Tony Crow, Jason Lehning, and Chris Carmichael -- and helmed by producer R.S. Field, Bucket's distorted guitars and chiming acoustics punctuate Mando's haunting tenor and unexpected phrases.</p><p>Born in San Luis Potosi, Mexico and raised in Corpus Christi by his music-loving parents on an eclectic diet of 60s-era songwriters, traditional Mexican music and the Everly brothers, Mando Saenz began guitar lessons at the age of 11. But the realization that he could write and perform music for a living didn't hit until he had done the &lsquo;responsible thing' and earned an MBA - if only to stick it in his back pocket.</p><p>He began playing live full-time and the response was encouragement enough to launch his career in DIY fashion. Soon, he joined the line of notable singer-songwriters to chronicle their lives in Texas via Watertown - originally self-released until landing in the hands of Carnival Music.</p><p>""Watertown had a definite underlying theme, and in some sense was almost a concept record - kind of revealing a lot of hidden truths,"" he says. ""Bucket changes gears a bit more and I wasn't afraid into slipping into a love song.""</p><p>The opening track of Bucket begins with exotic strumming and thumping tablas, matched with a drum loop and chiming, echoing guitar coming in slowly. ""Wrong Guy"" juxtaposes mellow mid-tempo pop-country with the macho, defiant stance of the narrator who is warning that he's a difficult person to be in a relationship -- saying ""And don't call my name / Cause I'll be right there with a bucket of hate.""</p><p>The leadoff single, ""Pocket of Red,"" is the flipside of ""Wrong Guy,"" -- written from the other person's perspective. Mando finished it with Kim Richey, and really wanted the hopeful pop-sounding music to reflect the alter ego of the song. Another song he wrote with Richey - ""All Grown Up,"" Mando says, is about being ""old and educated but you still don't know what the to say sometimes.""</p><p>""Pittsburgh"" is that song that hopefully every artist stumbles across - the song that everyone asks for during live shows, with a lilting melody that easily slips under the skin. It has been recorded, but never released. Mando started it with the melody, and pieced together the lyrics by writing 30 or so of random phrases that fit each line of the music then he, ""puzzled them together as best I could to keep the sentiment of the song; which is really up for grabs at the end of the day."" It wasn't until Bucket that Mando says they finally got it the way he heard it in his head, and it will always be a cornerstone of his live shows.</p><p>""Seven Dollars"" was written about being broke and young in a bar in Houston and having just the amount to get you by. Mando believes it's ""pretty abstract but pretty specific at the same time,"" which is a pretty good way to describe the album as a whole. But the song Mando sees as maybe being the most autobiographical on the album is ""Touch is All.""</p><p>""It's a song about moving around to be happy or not be happy,"" Mando explains, ""Or just feeling the need to move, whether it's moving to another town or just being restless in a restaurant. It's about not being able to stay in one place for very long -- and at the same time finding it hard not to miss for lots of reasons. Many of which you don't realize till your gone. The title refers to how much it takes to stay with you and also bring you back.""</p><p>It's this restlessness that drove him from Texas to Tennessee and that brought him to his new musical milieu, but has all the movement meant musical change?</p><p>At the end of the day, Mando believes that ""Songs are songs. Whether they were written in Texas, Tennessee or Idaho doesn't really matter.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.mandosaenz.com"" target=""_blank"">Mando Saenz Website</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",6417,$15 advance/ $18 day of show,,10/6/10 0:00Todd Wright,Tony Alany,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/tonyalany"" target=""_blank"">Tony Alany MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",6893,$12 ,,10/5/10 0:00Nathan Angelo + Todd Carey + Andrew Hoover,,,6720,,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Twenty-two-year-old singer/songwriter/guitarist Andrew Hoover brings to the table a pot full of home cooked acoustic soul, R&amp;B, and blues, stirred together with some tasty flamenco and colorful pop sprinkles. Which isn't surprising, really, since he originally trained to be a chef.</p><p>At age 14, Hoover apprenticed for two years with chefs at a AAA four-diamond restaurant in Connecticut in an effort to build his cooking knowledge base and really learn his way around a kitchen. He catered parties on the side to earn some money and even considered attending culinary school, but a comment from his sister about learning to play the guitar sparked something inside of him that would decide his future. Once Andrew picked up his first guitar he was hooked, and he started learning how to play the songs of his musical heroes. Visions of Michelin stars faded a bit and were put on the back burner, and Hoover sought to learn the instrument inside and out, watching YouTube videos and concert DVD's in an attempt to pick up guitar-playing techniques.</p><p>He started writing songs his senior year in high school, and started singing in college. ""Around the end of my freshman year,"" Hoover explains, ""it really started to hit me that this was something I wanted to do. I wanted to write songs and be a musician and make a living at it."" By the time his sophomore year in college rolled around, he was spending all of his free time in the music practice rooms when he wasn't doing homework. At the end of that year, with his parents' blessing, he quit school to follow his dream of making music full time.</p><p>He recorded his first EP in his garage, and self-released it in 2007. Andrew mapped out and booked his own tour, which took him from Maine down to Florida and west to Chicago, hitting all of the points in between. ""I just wanted to play,"" Hoover remembers. ""Anywhere I could find an audience, I was there. It was not just what I had to do to build a name for myself, but it was also what I wanted to do."" A second solo acoustic EP soon followed to stoke his growing fan base.</p><p>Andrew caught the attention of Rock Ridge Music through the new ""old fashioned way"" of MySpace outreach, sending messages to fans of comparable artists. Rock Ridge staffer Carly Kent received one of Andrew's messages, and liked what she heard enough to catch a show in New York. Blown away by what she saw, Kent passed along Andrew's demo to label President Jason Spiewak. Skeptical as always, Spiewak listened and was impressed. It was one of Hoover's YouTube videos that cemented Spiewak's interest. ""Andrew Hoover is a show-stopping entertainer. He draws people in with his percussive, unique style of guitar playing and makes them fall in love with his unbelievable voice.""</p><p>Hoover signed with Rock Ridge Music in 2008, and hit the studio with Spiewak in New York City to record his full-length debut. In addition to the NYC sessions, Andrew traveled South to work with Chris Henderson of 3 Doors Down fame at his Rivergate Studios in Hendersonville, Tennessee. The result is Hoover's full-band debut album, ""Chances, Stances &amp; Romances,"" which will be released on September 22, 2009.</p><p>Andrew is a solo musician, though he voices several instruments in his live shows. His unique slap guitar style carries inspirations from the bass and percussion instruments, giving his songs a groove and rhythm not often associated with singer-songwriters. His vocal style is raw and original, colorful, and dynamic. Andrew takes his cues from a variety of his heroes including but not limited to Stevie Wonder, Otis Redding, Marc Broussard, Ray LaMontagne, Raul Midon, James Morrison, and Martin Sexton.</p><p>Andrew kicked off 2010 by performing on Sixthman's The Rock Boat sharing the stage with artists such as Marc Broussard, Will Hoge, Stephen Kellogg &amp; The Sixers, Tyrone Wells, and Augustana. Throughout 2010 he will continue to tour to promote 'Chances, Stances &amp; Romances' and build on a touring history that already includes previous performances in support of Sister Hazel, Elliott Yamin, Tim Reynolds, Dave Barnes, Ernie Halter, Ari Hest, the Alternate Routes, and Kate Voegele.</p><p><a href=""http://www.andrewhoovermusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Hoover Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.toddcareymusic.com"" target=""_blank"">Todd Carey Website</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",6721,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,10/3/10 22:00Lights Over Paris,Hollywood Heartthrob,,0,Litchfield,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thelitchfield"" target=""_blank"">Litchfield MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/hollywoodheartthrob"" target=""_blank"">Hollywood Heartthrob MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",6741,$10 ,,10/3/10 2:00Crash Boom Omar CD Release Show,Stacy Clark,The Baby Grand + David (The Incorrigibles),0,Lehi (Boys Will Be Boys),"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/theincorrigiblesmusic"" target=""_blank"">The Incorrigibles MySpace</a><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/fctsva"" target=""_blank""><br /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.iamthebabygrand.com"" target=""_blank"">The Baby Grand Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/boyswillbeboys"" target=""_blank"">Boys Will Be Boys MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p><p>""There is a ton to like, love, and adore about Stacy Clark."" <em>-Absolutepunk.net</em></p><p>""Pop charmer Stacy Clark, whose on-stage style this night was pitched somewhere between Zooey Deschanel and a softer Katy Perry.

Adding full-band accompaniment to his lush, soulful pop-rock, Ruben also stretches impressively as a writer on The Ones That Matter, achieving a near-novelistic sense of character and setting on finely hewn tracks like ""A Lack of Armor,"" ""Bleeker and Sixth,"" and ""Unbreakable."" His relentless attention to detail pays off handsomely.</p><p>He makes no apology for meticulously fine-tuning all aspects of his work and presentation. ""Every time you create something you have an opportunity to say something new - or at least something honest,"" he says. ""I take that opportunity seriously.""</p><p>Ruben's expansive and deeply compassionate point of view has resonated strongly with an ever-growing audience, whom the performer has cultivated with virtually nonstop touring and persistent online networking; as a result, he's sold some 5,000 copies of Honesty on his own.</p><p>He often receives emotional messages from fans declaring that his songs have crystallized their feelings, commemorated milestones in their lives and even helped repair broken bonds. ""One woman wrote to me and said she and her daughter didn't get along, but when she drives the girl to school every day they listen to my music - and it's the only time they don't fight,"" he marvels. ""The songs I wrote in my basement helped her relationship with her daughter. How could I ask for more than that?"" Indeed, his compositions have connected so powerfully with listeners that several cover versions have been posted on YouTube.</p><p>Such moments of connection helped inspire the title of The Ones That Matter. Ruben had compiled a list of some 80 candidates, but it was in the aftermath of the recording process that he realized what the disc should be called.</p><p>""I was on an epic road trip,"" he remembers of this epiphany. ""I realized that as much as this album is about music, it's ultimately a representation of who I am - and all that amounts to is all the incredible people I've surrounded myself with, and the places I've spent time, and the stories and jokes that came out of those experiences with those people. That's when I understood that the only logical name for the album was The Ones That Matter.""</p><p>Recorded during a record-breaking snowstorm in Charlottesville, Virginia - where producer Chris Keup (Jason Mraz, OAR, Parachute) and partner Stewart Myers (Mraz, Lifehouse, Rachel Yamagata, Mandy Moore) have their studio - the disc afforded Ruben a chance to fully appreciate the devotion of his pals. ""I had some of my best friends in the world come down to help me finish the record,"" he relates. Other players on the disc include drummer Brian Jones (Mraz, Yamagata, Moore); and keyboardist Daniel Clark (Ryan Adams, kd lang, Moore). Meyers handled bass on several tracks.</p><p>The profound gratitude Ruben felt upon finishing the album snowballed in the coming days. ""I wanted the title of this record to express my thanks to everyone who mattered - not just my friends who worked on the record, but their friends. The people who gave me a couch to crash on, made me dinner, drove me to the train station. Everyone who came to my shows, and walked up to tell me what the songs meant to them. I'm thanking them all with this record.""</p><p>Ruben's story begins in the heart of a musical family. His father and grandfather were both professional musicians, performing at weddings, Bar Mitzvahs, corporate events and other gatherings in Philadelphia and its environs. Ruben recalls watching in awe as his dad's band rehearsed rock, pop and R&amp;B hits. He began taking piano lessons, but lost interest during his adolescence. ""I had told myself I couldn't play guitar because that was my dad's instrument,"" he notes. ""Then I realized how stupid that was."" His father bought him a cheap guitar with the promise of a better instrument if he made progress; the guitar felt right in Jesse's hands, and by age 16 he was writing songs.</p><p>The artist cites singer-songwriters like Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell and James Taylor as his greatest influences, but also admits a fondness for the standards penned by Cole Porter and the Gershwins. While he's loath to compare himself to his idols, he says he takes courage in their stories. ""Paul Simon wasn't always hailed as a genius,"" he points out. ""At first, he was a 20-year-old kid with a guitar who dreamed up these incredibly ambitious songs. Realizing that helped me give myself permission to write what I wanted to write.""</p><p>He only applied to one college: Berklee College of Music in Boston. His first year there was a struggle, as he plunked out rudimentary solos in guitar classes filled with fusion-shredding virtuosos. But once he was able to focus on songwriting, Ruben blossomed; regular gigging soon followed. ""By the time I graduated,"" he points out, ""I was on the road pretty much every weekend.""</p><p>As a live performer he racked up odd experiences like playing backyard barbecues, singing at a daytime Sweet 16 party, and even serenading a couple of fans on their anniversary (he showed up in their kitchen with his guitar, at the woman's bidding, to surprise her boyfriend). The gigs gradually got bigger, and soon Ruben was paying his rent with engagements across the East Coast - becoming adept at getting around by commuter rail, booking cheap flights, promoting his shows and maintaining contact with fans via Facebook, his blog and the comments on his YouTube video posts.</p><p>The online community also came in handy when he was recording his debut album. ""I had no money, and five of my friends held a Facebook fundraiser for me,"" he reports. ""They presented me with a giant check for $2,500 on my twenty-first birthday."" And though elements of this initial effort seem distant to him now, Ruben credits Honesty with giving him a leg up in building his audience; in addition to the brisk sales of his debut, he continues to enjoy rapturous fan feedback about its songs.</p><p>Upon graduating from Berklee in 2008, Ruben was already living out of a suitcase in his battle-tested Toyota. ""If I had my choice, I'd be touring all the time,"" he volunteers. ""I love the lifestyle - sleeping late and getting up and driving and playing and meeting a bunch of people and doing the same thing the next day. I love not having to worry about cleaning my room or doing dishes; I'm cool with living out of a suitcase; I'm just working toward the day when I can trade the Greyhound for a bus of my own.""</p><p>""I'm staying out of New York for a while,"" Ruben sings in ""A Lack of Armor,"" although that self-imposed exile may soon be coming to an end, as the singer-songwriter plans a move to the Empire State from his temporary base in Nashville. But for the time being, Ruben's true home is the road - where he'll no doubt continue to touch lives, have offbeat adventures and add new names to the ever-growing list of The Ones That Matter.</p><p><a href=""http://www.jesseruben.com"" target=""_blank"">Jesse Ruben Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",6541,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,9/30/10 23:00Howie Day,John Wesley Satterfield,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.<br /></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.johnwesleysatterfield.com"" target=""_blank"">John Wesley Satterfield Website</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",7064,$20 ,,9/29/10 22:30VMA Night At Jammin' Java!

Comprised of Ed Jentsch (Lead Vocals &amp; Guitar), Brendan Ciotta (Bass &amp; Background Vocals) and Wilson (Rhythm Guitar, Sampler &amp; Background Vocals), Sam Broe (drums) &amp; Mr. Kraig B. Greff  (Keys sometimes even live).</p><p>With the help of the talented Kraig B Greff on organ, keys, and accordian (not to mention his amazing sense of humor which we will not try to translate into text), things really started taking shape. The Slow Learners have framed their career with diverse, musical backgrounds that stem from studio engineer production, to the collective mastery of various instrumentation.</p><p>Influenced by such industry legends who include Bob Dylan, The Who, Citizen Cope, Tom Petty and Jimi Hendrix, The Slow Learners are creating records that are filled with humorous undertones; juxtaposed with simple, raw and direct lyrics.</p><p>With two, studio LPs recorded and currently in distribution, The Slow Learners have already begun to receive industry recognition by having some of their stand out singles aired via internet radio, as well as amongst an array of FM and Indie radio stations. In 2006, the band released their self-titled, debut compilation. The album was written and produced by lead vocalist, Ed Jentsch at various studios in and around the state of Maryland. The band's follow up project, Incomplete, was never officially mixed, and was distributed in a raw format. Combined, both compilations spawned the success of stand-out hits that include, Jesus Saves, 20 Class A Cigarettes, Hollywood and Party. The critical and commercial success of both projects led The Slow Learners into touring opportunities that further promoted their music to the masses.</p><p>During the past eight years, The Slow Learners have taken center stage at many of the increasing popular venues across Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia and New York City. Having performed at every club in The Greater Baltimore Metropolitan area, the band has been able to solidify their name amongst a cross culture of fans and fellow listeners. They've played various music festivals and conferences, playing as the opening act for Nationally acclaimed bands who include Poi Dog Pondering.</p><p>Presently, The Slow Learners are engaged in performing live &amp; pre-production of thier 4th LP. <br />Ultimately, The Slow Learners want to have their music showcased in global, television and cinematic projects.<br /> <br />Grounded in their desire to use their music as a simple reflection of Life, The Slow Learners want to tour the world, attracting a vivid array of new fans along the way.</p><p><a href=""http://theslowlearners.com"" target=""_blank"">The Slow Learners Website</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",7066,$9 advance/ $11 at the door,,9/27/10 23:00Maria Muldaur and Her Red Hot Bluesianna Band,,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",6273,$20 advance/ $25 day of show,,9/26/10 23:00"Math, Music & Mayhem Tour with Score 24 + Eleventyseven",Sub-Radio Standard,,6785,Forever Is Forever,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.<br /></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/foreverisforevermusic"" target=""_blank"">Forever Is Forever MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/subradiostandard"" target=""_blank"">Sub-Radio Standard MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/eleventyseven"" target=""_blank"">Eleventyseven MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",6786,$10 ,,9/26/10 2:00Joe Brooks,Alexe Colbus,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/alexecolbus"" target=""_blank"">Alexe Colbus MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",6936,$10 ,,9/25/10 23:00Jason Reeves,Trent Hancock,,0,,"<p><strong>LATE SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Its not uncommon for indie artists to cite The Beatles as primary musical influences--but the San Diego singer/songwriter <strong>Trent Hancock</strong> is breaking nationally with his solo EP debut, Ghostbird, which uniquely weaves the Fab Fours style into certain tracks.</p><p>Though hailing from the west coast, Hancocks other inspiration for the Ghostbird EP comes from relocating to the raw streets of Brooklyn. The singer was so impressed and inspired from touring in New York City last year that he took the plunge and embarked on a cross-country drive. Hancock began immersing himself into the citys open mic showcase scene, and on one particular night, he included the dark-themed Beatles tune Happiness Is A Warm Gun into his acoustic set  only to realize that, unlike in San Diego where everyone wants to hear cover bands, NYC crowds frown on the practice. The crowds desire to hear original material inspired Hancock to develop some new songs with a mainstream pop/rock sound, which he would eventually release on the new Ghostbird EP.</p><p>Hancocks love for the Beatles, NYC, and his new material would served him well a few months later after moving to Brooklyn, when he impressed Los Angeles producers Mikal Blue (Colbie Caillat, Five For Fighting and OneRepublic) and his partner Andrew Williams (Hope, Angel Taylor, Colbie Caillat and Five For Fighting) with his new music vision. The two producers immediately asked Hancock to fly L.A. to work the singers new project. He was excited for the opportunity to work with Williams and Blue, who helmed Colbie Caillaits double platinum debut Coco.</p><p>Hancock has come a long way from his post college days in cover bands in San Diego and his once successful electronic rock duo (also called Ghostbird), along with drummer Mike Cooper. Though Hancock is now turned on to another musical genre and is taking on the solo career by storm, the duos name lives on as the title of Hancocks current EP.  The new EP also secured Hancock to tour in July and August across the U.S. with renowned acoustic soul singer/songwriters Ernie Halter and Tony Lucca, and recently picked up endorsements by Gibson Guitars and Sennheiser USA.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/trenthancock"" target=""_blank"">Trent Hancock MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><br /></em></p>",6819,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,9/25/10 2:00Caroline Herring,,,0,,"<p><strong>EARLY SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5624,$12 ,,9/24/10 22:00Dia + Mista Forty + Socz,Sonny Black,,7005,,"<p><strong>LATE SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.<br /></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/sonnyblack11"" target=""_blank"">Sonny Black MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Socz was born, raised and currently residing in Washington D.C.

Touring continually on both sides of the Atlantic ever since, Vandaveer has played 250+ shows, sharing stages with a host of humbling artists including Bon Iver, Alejandro Escovedo, Vashti Bunyan, Vetiver, Evan Dando, Scout Niblett, The Ditty Bops, Smog, Fleet Foxes, Alela Diane and his dear friends in DC's ramshackle collective, The Federal Reserve. In addition to said Vandaveering, Heidinger has been known to fraternize and conspire with other music-making hooligans, primarily as a bassist with fellow DCers These United States.</p><p>Vandaveer's sophomore effort, Divide &amp; Conquer, touches upon similar themes found in its elder sibling, winding timeworn themes of love &amp; death, malice &amp; goodwill, sin &amp; perseverance into (mostly) four-minute vignettes. To see D&amp;C through, Vandaveer enlisted the able assistance of longtime collaborator and producer Duane Lundy, brothers-in-arms/TUS bandmates Robby Cosenza and Justin Craig, and most notably, his fair sister Rose Guerin, supplying the loveliest harmonies this side of Eden. A decidedly more produced venture, D&amp;C offers up a flourishing chamber folk companion to its bedroomy lo-fi folk/pop predecessor.</p><p>Divide &amp; Conquer was released in France, Belgium and Switzerland on April 6th, 2009 via Alter K. Records and in the USA on August 25th, 2009 via Supply &amp; Demand Music.</p><p>""Jarring new folk."" <em>-ROLLING STONE</em></p><p>""The music on Vandaveer's second album, Divide &amp; Conquer, reflects the duality an old soul and a little child trapped in a 32-year-old's body, with lyrics referencing both World War I and children's author Beverly Cleary in daydreamy songs featuring rich piano melodies and the pure, delicate voice of bandmate Rose Guerin."" <em>-PASTE</em></p><p>Extensive touring behind Vandaveer's first record, ""Grace &amp; Speed,"" has helped the singer strengthen his songwriting and bump up his street cred. On ""Divide &amp; Conquer"" he has worked himself into a world-weary wayfaring minstrel with shoe-leather vocal cords and breathy Dylanesque folk tunes rife with imagery cribbed from Testaments both Old and New. <em>-WASHINGTON POST</em></p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/vandaveer"" target=""_blank"">Vandaveer MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",6583,$14 ,,9/20/10 23:30ABIGAIL WASHBURN,Teddy & The Roosevelts,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ted Pitney, co-founder and songwriter from King Wilkie, has just released his debut CD, The Genesee EP.

With ""Swallow the Sea"" I didn't want to go the route of the low-fi indie record. The title represents what I was going for. I also have to stay true to my roots. I'm a product of the 80's and my musical taste was shaped largely by bands like The Pixies, REM, U2, Echo and the Bunnymen and other underground bands of that time. It was the era of epic art-rock and smart pop. I ate it up. This record certainly nods to my influences without apology.""</p><p>Ambition is evident in Matthew Perryman Jones' third record, but first proper release. From the sense of hope that swells from the darkness of the opening track to the epic reinterpretation of the spiritual, ""Motherless Child"" to the closing track's two minute mantra, ""Where can you go? Can you Swallow the Sea?"", this record is the sound of Jones simultaneously putting his neck on the line and shedding musical inhibitions, and finding his voice in doing so.</p><p>Regarding ""Swallow the Sea"" Jones confesses, ""It seems I can't get away from dealing with darker elements. The only way I can approach them, in my life and in my writing, is to approach them from a hopeful perspective. I think that's apparent on this record. Otherwise, I think the inclination is to not want to address those things...not wanting to go there if you can't see a way out.""</p><p>Jones was born near Philadelphia and relocated to Atlanta at the age of 11. As a teenager he fell in love with the bands of the nearby Athens, Georgia music scene, including R.E.M., and the likes of Guadalcanal Diary and Mary My Hope. He began writing songs in high school, where he also formed his first band, and was 15 when they recorded their first five-song demo (produced by Indigo Girls producer Don McCollister.)</p><p>By the mid-90s, he was fronting an Atlanta folk-rock band with steady gigs at the legendary Eddie's Attic. As his own songwriting began to bloom and solo shows at Eddie's followed, friends encouraged the burgeoning artist to pursue his music full-time. Before long, Jones had packed his things and was headed for Nashville. After relocating, Jones soon found a pocket of independent artists who quickly became his musical community. Touring and writing with these contemporaries has contributed to Jones' growth as an artist. In collaborating with local talents, he eventually became acquainted with producer Neilson Hubbard with whom he soon began working.</p><p>Swallow the Sea is Jones' second consecutive album with Hubbard (Garrison Starr, Glen Phillips, Matthew Ryan). ""With this record there was a bit of a struggle in that (musically) subtlety seems to be en vogue these days and I wanted to make a bigger record because those are the records I've always been into."" As he did on 2006's Throwing Punches in the Dark, the disc finds Jones writing in a stream-of-consciousness manner, coming up with song ideas in a spur-of-the-moment fashion. ""It's kind of like getting in your car and driving around and seeing what you can find.""</p><p>""Save You"" (co-written with Hubbard) was the first track on the record to garner attention via multiple television placements (Kyle XY, Private Practice) and resulted in an internet groundswell, as well as being the impetus for this new album. Jones' strength as a writer is further showcased on this record from the aggressive pop of ""Without a Clue"" to the breezy ""Amelia"" and the quirky ""When it Falls Apart"".</p><p><a href=""http://www.mpjmusic.com"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Perryman Jones Website</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",6591,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,9/12/10 21:00Matt Hires,Wakey!Wakey!,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>""Mike Grubbs could speak for each and every one of us when he pulls at our heartstrings with tales of lost love and broken spirits.

Half Brother has several singles at the time, but a full length LP is on its way. Jack Hubbell plays lead electric guitar, sings, and writes most of the lyrics. Jack's late 60's hard rock/blues stile of guitar playing is a strong part of the group's sound. Wile jack's writeing exposes his punk rock favorites. Jacks music production skills are a key element of half brother. Erik Liner plays the drums; and is a very talented musician. Erik contributes a lot to the group's sound. He is also a key element in the group's song writing. Erik keps the band smiling by telling jokes. Last but not least, Calvin Jimmy Sumpter (or CJ for short) is the bassist for half brother. CJ didn't know how to play bass before he joined but he lives near jack so we took the time to teach him .... and now he is good.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/halfbrotherband"" target=""_blank"">Half Brother MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",6935,$10 ,,9/9/10 23:00Dreaming of Eden,Restless Street,,0,,"<p><strong>EARLY SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/restlessstreet"" target=""_blank"">Restless Street MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><br /></em></p>",6924,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,9/9/10 0:00Life Rocks!

He experimented with songwriting and fell hard into the trap that is the greatness of Bob Dylan.</p><p>After college, the &lsquo;real world' soon caught up with Casey and music took a back seat.

I spent about one year writing, recording, and mixing the songs that appear on my new CD ""Let's Make This Unforgettable"" and I have never been more excited about a music project.  I have been a musician all of my life, developing my skills into an expert level on guitar, drums, bass, and singing.  I performed all of these instruments on this CD I am submitting  and I think the 7 songs on this album will demonstrate my musical ability, knowledge of music theory, professionalism, and most importantly, my love and passion for music.</p><p>""Let's Make This Unforgettable"" is an album in which I delve into different levels of rock and explore my creativity and curiosity for the sake of trying something new.  Songs such as ""Sent Down"" and ""Operations"" have a bit more of a hard rock/metal element with double-bass grooves and aggressive vocals.  ""Purpose of the Moon"" and ""Let's Make this Unforgettable"" are more of the alternative rock ballads including a few interesting twists with the addition of keyboards and a pan flute; while  ""My Rising Sun"", ""All I can Give"", ""Motionless"", and ""HIdden in Mexico"" are  what you may hear on the radio with their ability to get stuck in your head.  I would define my overall sound as an Incubus and Sevendust sandwich with A Day to Remember on the side.</p><p>My dream has always been to make it big in the music industry and I've thought that the moment I see my face on a t-shirt, I could retire!  But the reality is that I feel as though I've found my niche with music performance and writing.  I've spent the past two years working behind a desk as a program analyst for a defense contractor, and I made the ""bold"" decision to leave the comfort of a Government job and pursue a music career.  I'm in competition with thousands, if not millions of others to get their name out to the public and sell tickets to their shows, but my determination and perseverance sets me apart from the rest.  As a 25 year-old, I feel like my dream is still obtainable and I could do great things for the music industry by writing or performing music.  I'm currently seeking management that can help propel my dream!</p><p>Since 1998 I have played in various bands throughout Virginia.  This includes playing drums for my high school jazz band to playing in front of a near sold out crowd at the NORVA in Norfolk, VA with my college band Clock Strikes Murder (Hunt Records).  Clock Strikes Murder was a MetalCore band based in Chesapeake, VA.  We played shows all over Virginia and North Carolina until mid 2008 when we disbanded.  Our reputation was built on more than our sound, it was our stage presence and the energy we could bring to our shows that ultimately augmented our fan base.</p><p>Over the years I have gained knowledge though experience and learning from other artists about the music industry, and life in general as a musician.  I feel more comfortable on stage or in front of manuscript paper than I do in my own bed.  I live for music as it courses through my veins.  I believe that once the world has a chance to hear what I can do, only good things can happen!</p><p><a href=""http://www.shoemusicrocks.com"" target=""_blank"">Shoes Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nate has been playing guitar since he was 5 years old.

Although there were plenty of times where we never thought it would all come together, it did and it was actually far more successful than we ever imagined it would be. We carried the momentum built up from the tour and the release of ""Hold the Ground"" last August and kept on trucking. We have played more shows this past year than at any other point in our careers and we could not be happier. We also just finished recording two new tracks - ""Fool My Eyes"" and ""Lonely Bones"" - in addition to remixing and remastering the entire ""Hold The Ground"" EP to make it sound even more beastly. Hopefully the two new songs become your new two favorite Await Rescue songs and you enjoy the second version of HTG more than you did the first version.<br /> <br />""This hard rock quintet from our very own Boston blew me away.

Now, he hits the road again to promote his most recent release &lsquo;Everything Just Happened the Way that it Happened.' These 11 songs chronicle the scenes and episodes experienced and witnessed during his life on the road. During that time his address changed from Miami to Nashville to Boston until most recently returning to his hometown of Richmond, VA.</p><p>His recent homecoming has found Fields selling out shows in Richmond VA, as well as nearby Washington DC. ""Dean Fields writes lyrics like Leonard Cohen and sings like Jeff Buckley. It's no surprise that there's a serious buzz on this Virginia singer-songwriter."" (Free Times) While continuing to feed his passion for music, Dean is fueled by a single-minded love to perform, sharing the stage with KT Tunstall, Blues Traveler, Rosanne Cash, Auqualung, Hootie and the Blowfish, John Hiatt, Cake, Bruce Hornsby, Rusted Root, Madeleine Peyroux, Carbon Leaf, among others. In addition, Fields' maturity as a writer and performer is brought to the fore by some of the region's finest musicians. The band features members of Mandy Moore, Sparklehorse, Agents of Good Roots, KD Lang, Carbonleaf and Modern Groove Syndicate.</p><p>Everything Just Happened the Way that it Happened, Dean's latest release, was written mostly in bars, venues, and hotels while on tour since hitting the road in 2003. The album's 11 songs capture the raw honest expression of a young artist on the rise and the experiences that come with it: the teetering balance of hope and hopelessness in life's pursuits; relationships and break-ups; along with the physical and emotional ups and downs of being on the road. This album is a reflection of his maturity as an artist and heartfelt reflections of his experiences while pursuing his dream. ""It's about being at peace with the decisions we make and the benefits and consequences that come with them"" states Fields. Prior to his release of Everything Just Happened the Way that it Happened, Fields released ""Songs on the Mend,"" a solo acoustic album and his debut album ""Imitations,"" produced by Alan Weatherhead, independently selling over 5000 copies.</p><p>Dean began his career in 2001 while living in Miami. After being inspired by the abrupt break-up of a long-term love interest, Fields began to document his pain and sadness the only way he knew how....he wrote about it. ""I was living in this beautiful place with gorgeous people and amazing nightlife, and where was I? Holed up in a corner room depressed and writing songs."" Upon receiving the distinction of ""Best of Miami"" and performing at the premier Billboard Live, the singer-songwriter made the decision to leave Miami and dedicate himself to developing his craft and performing live. ""I just woke up one day and said, 'screw this all I want to do is play music.' And off I went."" Influenced by great songwriters like Jim Croce, James Taylor and Lucinda Williams, Fields has blended a mix of folk-alternative Americana to create a sound only unique to him. His natural and melancholy voice stands out from the mix. ""He sings with the tender high tenor of Tim Buckley and the plain spoken poetry of Jim Croce.""(Miami Herald) Fields is truly in his element on stage. His live performances showcase his unassuming yet candid personality; an &lsquo;ah shucks' sort of charisma audiences are drawn to. They cant help but watch, and listen, and be a part of the experiences unfolding in song.</p><p>In addition to releasing two albums since taking to the road in 2003 Fields has been showcasing his talents at BMI songwriter showcases in Nashville, Los Angeles, New York and at the BMI Brunch at SXSW. He was also the Southeast Region finalist in the independent music world series in 2004, chosen over a group of 1200 acts and has had his music featured on MTV's Real World, Road Rules and Sorority Life.</p><p>Fields continues to win over critics and audiences everywhere.

He pushed us, like a coach would, and made us do our absolute best, so at times it was nerve-racking, like 'Ah, I can't do this anymore, I need a break for a little bit,' but he pushed us and I'm really happy that he did because I love how it turned out.""</p><p>THE GRADUATE eagerly awaits hitting the road and sharing the new material with fans.

It all started with Paul being the original ukulele master, having one since the beginning of time. Then Davy received an uke for Christmas 2009. After seeing the joy these magical instruments can bring, Caleb decided to get an ukulele of his own. In addition to all having ukuleles, each member had one more common thread, the same debate/forensics class. It was a class in which they brought their ukuleles and could jam freely, but only under one condition: their final project must be to write and record an album. Instead of discouraging such creativity, their teacher, Ms. Kiggins, promoted their uniqueness and led to the formation of The Humans. For the next two months, 90 minutes of every other school day was devoted to playing covers or brainstorming song ideas in Edison's stairwells and courtyard, with exception to the times when they had substitutes who did not believe a teacher would allow such a thing. Little did they now, for now The Humans have become Northern Virginia's best Tragical-Comical-Historical-Pastoral-Ukulele-Folk-Rock Band. Currently, The Humans spend their time working on their album, entitled ""An Album"", which will be out in the summer of 2010. In addition, they perform on the streets of Old Town Alexandria, making friends with Canadians, bikers, and anybody who will listen. The Humans would like to thank all of their friends, family, fans/groupies, and of course Ms. Kiggins.

Their songs are too compelling and the performances too much fun to resist getting caught up in them, be that singing along, feeling your heart squeeze or more than likely both. Madi Diaz is, of course, Madi herself, the 23-year-old, Nashville-based musician. But for the purposes of making music together, Madi Diaz is also the name under which the duo of Madi and Kyle Ryan perform. The naming convention is not unlike Gillian Welch, who shares an eponymous pairing with David Rawlings. Or Bon Jovi. Madi and Kyle truly make their own kind of music, drawing inspiration from the pop bands that mattered, the singer-songwriters for whom roots rock was just a starting point and that slender sliver of indie that can still surprise. If the left of the dial still exists, that's where you'll hear them.</p><p>She grew up as part of a musical family in Lancaster, PA, near the heart of Amish country. Her father, Eric Svalgard, serves as Music Director at the Wilmington, Delaware campus of the Paul Green School of Rock Music (her brother Max is also an instructor there). As a teenager, Madi herself was one of Green's star pupils at the original Rock School in Philadelphia (she's one of the students prominently featured in Don Argott's 2005 documentary film about the program). Ryan, 26, hails from Lincoln, Nebraska, where there ""wasn't much to do other than become really passionate about something."" He eschewed popular regional choices like football and meth in favor of music, and played drums in a number of local bands before enrolling in the University of Nebraska. The physics major also switched instruments and when guitar playing began to usurp the study of wave phenomena, a transfer was in order.</p><p>Madi and Kyle met in Boston where each relocated to attend the Berklee College of Music. They test drove their musical partnership and budding friendship through the process of recording Madi's self-released 2007 album Skin and Bone. Following its release, the pair (often accompanied by bassist Adam Popick) gigged around Boston and New York City, attracting publishing and management deals on the strength of their songwriting and live performances. Having each found, as Madi puts it, ""the right buddy to orbit around,"" the pair decided to decamp the cold of the northeast for Nashville, where Popick had transplanted a few months earlier. While it might appear to be a step towards country, the music scene in Music City has long veered away from singer-songwriter norms and into something more varied and collaborative.</p><p>Within weeks of the 2008 move, they were performing at The Basement and Mercy Lounge, and teaming up with new and old friends alike including Tim Lauer, Daniel Tashien, Sarah Siskind, Garrison Starr, David Mead, Ian Fitchuk and Justin Loucks. Studio sessions with Fitchuk and Loucks behind the boards yielded 2009's six-song EP Ten Gun Salute (characterized by one reviewer as ""tinged with heartbreak, yet sunny in melody""). The sound of Ten Gun Salute was a progression from Madi's debut, exploring more classic pop-rock veins in terms of instrumentation and arrangements, always from an experimental angle With the EP in hand and further opportunities to perform across the country, in 2009 even more folks began to take notice. Paste magazine named them one of the ""Top Ten Buzziest Acts"" at SXSW, with writer Steve LaBate praising their ""inviting"" performance, ""especially Diaz's voice, an instrument that comforts as if a favorite blanket leftover from childhood."" The esteemed Songwriters Hall of Fame conferred the Abe Oleman Scholarship for Excellence in Songwriting upon Madi, while American Songwriter magazine pegged her Writer of the Week in October.</p><p>In June, she and Ryan played their biggest show to date at the Bonnaroo Festival, and in addition to their own continued touring, Madi joined fellow Nashvillians in the fall for the national 10 Out of Tenn tour. Madi Diaz and Kyle Ryan have just finished working with producer John Alagia (Dave Matthews Band, John Mayer, Liz Phair, Rachel Yamagata) on a new full-length album titled Plastic Moon, recorded in Matthews' Charlottesville, VA studio.</p><p><a href=""http://www.madidiaz.com/"" target=""_blank"">Madi Diaz Website</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5987,$10 ,,8/18/10 0:00Circa Survive,O'Brother,,0,,"<p><strong><br /></strong></p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/obrothermusic"" target=""_blank"">O'Brother MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",6539,$20 ,,8/16/10 23:00Shannon McNally and Hot Sauce,Anne McCue,,0,Rebecca Pronsky,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rebecca's songs are ""literate, passionate, and wry"" (Time Out NY) with ""brutal, cutting lyricism"" (Ithaca Times), but it's her ""big jazz-trained voice"" (Village Voice) that really steals the show.

McCue recorded and produced the album at her own Flying Machine Studio  in Nashville. It was mixed by Mike Esser at 16 Ton Studio and was  mastered by Ray Kennedy at Zen Masters.</p><p>McCue recorded the album whilst waiting to record a new electric  album. Inspired by the golden era of folk pop music which took place in  the late sixties with such albums as Rubber Soul, Aftermath, bands like  The Byrds and artists like Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, Anne set about  recording, playing every instrument she could get her hands on -  guitars, mandolin, cheatin' banjo, piano, harmonica, lap steel, slide  banjo, bass guitar, ukulele, shaker, tambourine, organ, drum etc.</p><p>Special guests include Eamon McLoughlin of The Green Cards (violin,  viola &amp; cello); Irish singer/songwriter Tony Kerr (backing vocals);  artist Leslie Mills (tapdance) and Dave Ray of The Coalmen (snare drum) .  While Anne is primarily known for her guitar playing skills, she gets  to stretch out here on many other instruments and undertook all  production and recording duties for the album. She was also able to call  on her arranging skills for the string section in ""Money In The  Morning"".</p><p>""I wanted to stay close to that late sixties folk rock ethic, keeping  it real, not adding too much instrumentation, keeping the story and the  melody in the forefront ... Being included on the '4 Decades of Folk  Rock' anthology encouraged me to follow this path and style which I am  naturally inclined toward anyway. Recording an album at home seemed like  something great and productive to do whilst waiting for the dust to  settle in the music business around me..."" says McCue.</p><p>As one of the foremost female guitarists of our time, Anne has been  invited to play at the Jimi Hendrix Tribute Concert at the Adelaide  Guitar Festival alongside world renowned guitarists such as Vernon Reid  and John Hammond.</p><p>Anne has appeared as guest guitarist/vocalist on albums by Michelle  Shocked, Gina Villalobos and Stephen Rowe and has been featured in  Guitar Player Magazine, No Depression, Harp, Performing Songwriter,  Billboard, Australian Musician etc...</p><p>Her song 'Stupid' is included on the Time Life release '4 Decades Of  Folk Rock' which features such legendary artists as Bob Dylan, The  Byrds, Crosby, Stills and Nash, Suzanne Vega and Patty Griffin.</p><p>She has released her fourth solo album, Koala Motel, to critical  acclaim and has recently co-produced two albums by other artists -  Stephen Rowe and Leila Florentino.</p><p>Guests on 'Koala Motel' include Lucinda Williams, John Doe, Nancy  Wilson (Heart), Jim Lauderdale and Doug 'Lovejoy' Pettibone.</p><p>Anne recently took part in The Broad Festival - a national tour of  Australia put together by Deborah Conway in which she played at concert  halls all over Australia including the Sydney Opera House.</p><p>Her two previous albums were recorded at Dusty Wakeman's Mad Dog  Studios in Burbank, California and were released on the Messenger  Records label. McCue and Wakeman co-produced the albums. Going in with  the philosophy of some of Anne's favourite three piece bands, on 'Roll'  she played the guitars, Dusty played bass with Dave Raven on the drums.  The three jammed on the material. Carl Byron added keyboards. The album  has received critical acclaim from such publications as Billboard,  Entertainment Weekly and XM Satellite Radio (Top 5 Album of the Year)  and was picked by Bob Harris of the BBC as his favourite album of 2004.</p><p>Offered the chance to play music in Vietnam for a year Anne found it,  ""an unbelievable experience and it really changed my life. It also gave  me the chance to hone my lead guitar playing."" Anne rode a 1965 Vesper  and toted her guitar around on the bike 'just like the locals'. After  playing in all kinds of bands almost every night it was time to return  to Melbourne where she frequented the blues jams.</p><p>She continued recording her original songs but took the opportunity  to become a member of a group which was soon signed to Columbia Records  giving Anne the opportunity to tour the U.S. and Canada as part of the  ""Lilith Fair."" This experience brought her on stage with many of the  greats such as The Pretenders, Emmylou Harris and Sarah McLachlan and  took her to Los Angeles. The band proved to be creatively frustrating  for Anne, so she left the group to pursue her interrupted solo career.</p><p>Eventually she completed her debut album ""Amazing Ordinary Things"".  Anne co-produced all the tracks except ""Angel Inside"" which was produced  by Larry Klein (Joni Mitchell). The CD is named after a painting by  Jules C.

Since their inception, McTwist has developed an unyielding work ethic, an unmistakable sound, and a dedicated fan base.</p><p>With the release of their debut album, Amateur Hour, McTwist has created a niche in the powerful Maryland and Northern Virginia music scenes. The album is an exemplar of what makes McTwist distinctive: powerful guitar, heartfelt lyricism, and a creative rhythm section. They play a brand of rock that is dedicated to being true to their wide-ranging influences, drawing from the genres of pop rock, punk, alternative rock, acoustic rock and surf rock. McTwist is as comfortable sweating and jumping through a two hour electric performance, as they are entering into a songwriter's circle and completely stripping down their music. This kind of versatility fuels their undying passion.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/mctwistrock"" target=""_blank"">McTwist MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Columbus, Ohio based pop punkers City Lights formed in early 2008, and since have established themselves as a band with instantly loveable songs and a live presence to be reckoned with. For their debut EP ""Rock Like A Party Star,"" the guys created songs that have instilled strong connections with their growing fan base. Featuring catchy melodies, explosive drums, and melodic, yet heavy guitars, RLAPS is a must-add to your summer play list. It is sure to bring back fond memories of good times, as well as help create some new ones. Growing up, Oshie (Vocals), Sean (Drums), Joey (Guitar), Jack (Guitar), and Chase (Bass) were just five kids listening to the same music, and that's what sparked their friendships, and led to what City Lights is today. Through their music, the guys want to be able to create those same kinds of friendships, and that's what they've set out to do from the beginning. Since releasing RLAPS, the guys have been touring non stop, including a recent run with Mayday Parade, There For Tomorrow, and The Dangerous Summer. City Lights now plans to return to the studio to record new material for an EP due out this spring.

After returning to Virginia from several years of dry air in the New Mexico mountains, the brothers began arranging a repertoire of traditional , cover, and original songs. Blending distinct but obviously familial voices, the brothers created a sound akin to the humble music that graced these Appalachian mountains many years ago. With two guitars and little training, the two produced a sound that they and many others seemed to enjoy hearing. Writing songs of heartbreak, travel, lust, and more heartbreak, the brothers stuck primarily to the things they had experienced in their rather short lives. Sing only what you know, and you will never go astray they say. With several sets of music prepared the brothers soon added long time friend Michael Emmons to thicken the sound. Bringing a keen ear for melody played on both banjo and dobro, Emmons quickly became an integral part of the sound and the Brothers became the Boys. Around the same time, Ryan retired the guitar and indulged in his love for the upright bass, bringing the group down into the deepest level of the resonant chambers of the heart . In 2008 The Green Boys met and befriended Jonathan Burkett, a Fredericksburg local who had attracted the band with his subtle touch and feel on the drums. After a few short gigs, Burkett became the fourth and seemingly final member of the band that now tours the state of Virginia with eyes upon the country at large. The Green Boys released their first EP in April of 2010 (available for purchase or preview at: http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/GreenBoys ) and plan to release an LP within the next year. They are currently booking shows in Fredericksburg, Charlottesville, Richmond, and D.C. and are open to bids from any and all other townships or villas. Their shows attract a mixed age and multicultural crowd that can only be explained by the virtues of the music they play.

Playing as a bassist in several bands over the years, Dion Roy has graced the stage at all of the usual NYC suspects, including The Bitter End, The Red Lion, Pianos, and Arctica Bar, and opened for high-profile acts like The Donnas, Bleu, and Ben Kweller, while touring throughout the North-Eastern College circuit.</p><p>This introspective and enigmatic musician has moved on from group bassist to solo vocalist and songwriter, with a debut CD (""Gallery"") released in June 2009. While Roy's songs draw upon personal experiences (he calls the album ""very personal"") they also speak to a greater audience about conflicting perspectives and desires. The ten-track album ""Gallery"" features songs whose themes include addictive love (""Come Back Around"") and failed relationships (""Wants It""), the betrayal brought on by a loved one's substance abuse (""Orchid""), and the useless carnage of war (""Blind World""). The common thread throughout these diverse songs is Roy's fresh combination of catchy pop hooks with brooding, raw emotionality.</p><p>WDHA 105.5 DJ Lindsay Klein gushes that Roy has ""raw and natural talent...with amazing energy pouring into his lyrics and music"". And Ed Jupp, music blogger at 17 Seconds, calls Dion Roy's debut ""something special, routed in its' wonderful simplicity... A man who could make us believe in the notion of the singer-songwriter again!""</p><p>His blend of genres has drawn comparisons to other singer/songwriters like Ryan Adams, Pete Yorn, and Damien Rice, and electronic bands such as Keane, Postal Service, and Snow Patrol. But what distinguishes this young artist is his genuine lack of pretense and his guarded nature. He almost never reveals the stories behind his songs, encouraging his fans to find their own connection to the words.</p><p>His debut album ""Gallery"" was released on June 9th, 2009 and is available on Amazon and iTunes.

""It's the only thing I want to do. I'd rather die in a ditch somewhere than not be able to make music. There are no other options for me. Music is my way of getting things out. It has saved my life many times.""</p><p>Such intense statements may sound like the drama of being a teenager, which Leming is, but spend any time with this thoughtful 19-year-old and it quickly becomes clear that it's true. Josiah Leming plays music as if his life depended on it, because for him, it does. Born and raised in the hard-luck rural town of Morristown, TN, Leming left home at 17 to make it as a musician, leaving behind eight siblings (six of whom are adopted), an out-of-work stepfather, and a mother battling serious illness. As Leming traveled around the Southeast playing open-mic nights in any club or coffeehouse that would have him, he slept in his car and took odd jobs to pay for food and gas, all the while dreaming about the album he would one day make.</p><p>Now he has finally gotten his chance. Leming has begun recording his debut album for Warner Bros. Records, with whom he signed a recording and publishing deal not long after appearing on Season 7 of American Idol. His brief, yet memorable time on the show spurred fans to turn up in droves online to demand his reinstatement. They sent him messages of support and encouragement. Many posted clips of themselves performing Leming's original songs on YouTube.</p><p>""No matter what I've gone through, I have the same feelings every kid has,"" Leming says. ""And I think I can put those feelings in such a way that they connect with people and help them get through their hard times. If my music can give others something they can express their emotions through, that's the whole point.""</p><p>""I try to use imagery that really sticks with people, but at the same time, every song I write is about something I've been through,"" Leming says. ""So it's impossible for me to write a song that doesn't tell a story. I can't write about things I don't feel. That's just faking it and I want the music to be real. I can't control what anyone thinks of it, but I can promise that it's going to come from my heart.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/josiahleming"" target=""_blank"">Josiah Leming MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This Chicago born, guitar slinging songwriter just hit the top forty iTunes charts with his 5.25.2010 EP release ""After the Morning After"".

Adding full-band accompaniment to his lush, soulful pop-rock, Ruben also stretches impressively as a writer on The Ones That Matter, achieving a near-novelistic sense of character and setting on finely hewn tracks like ""A Lack of Armor,"" ""Bleeker and Sixth,"" and ""Unbreakable."" His relentless attention to detail pays off handsomely.</p><p>He makes no apology for meticulously fine-tuning all aspects of his work and presentation. ""Every time you create something you have an opportunity to say something new - or at least something honest,"" he says. ""I take that opportunity seriously.""</p><p>Ruben's expansive and deeply compassionate point of view has resonated strongly with an ever-growing audience, whom the performer has cultivated with virtually nonstop touring and persistent online networking; as a result, he's sold some 5,000 copies of Honesty on his own.</p><p>He often receives emotional messages from fans declaring that his songs have crystallized their feelings, commemorated milestones in their lives and even helped repair broken bonds. ""One woman wrote to me and said she and her daughter didn't get along, but when she drives the girl to school every day they listen to my music - and it's the only time they don't fight,"" he marvels. ""The songs I wrote in my basement helped her relationship with her daughter. How could I ask for more than that?"" Indeed, his compositions have connected so powerfully with listeners that several cover versions have been posted on YouTube.</p><p>Such moments of connection helped inspire the title of The Ones That Matter. Ruben had compiled a list of some 80 candidates, but it was in the aftermath of the recording process that he realized what the disc should be called.</p><p>""I was on an epic road trip,"" he remembers of this epiphany. ""I realized that as much as this album is about music, it's ultimately a representation of who I am - and all that amounts to is all the incredible people I've surrounded myself with, and the places I've spent time, and the stories and jokes that came out of those experiences with those people. That's when I understood that the only logical name for the album was The Ones That Matter.""</p><p>Recorded during a record-breaking snowstorm in Charlottesville, Virginia - where producer Chris Keup (Jason Mraz, OAR, Parachute) and partner Stewart Myers (Mraz, Lifehouse, Rachel Yamagata, Mandy Moore) have their studio - the disc afforded Ruben a chance to fully appreciate the devotion of his pals. ""I had some of my best friends in the world come down to help me finish the record,"" he relates. Other players on the disc include drummer Brian Jones (Mraz, Yamagata, Moore); and keyboardist Daniel Clark (Ryan Adams, kd lang, Moore). Meyers handled bass on several tracks.</p><p>The profound gratitude Ruben felt upon finishing the album snowballed in the coming days. ""I wanted the title of this record to express my thanks to everyone who mattered - not just my friends who worked on the record, but their friends. The people who gave me a couch to crash on, made me dinner, drove me to the train station. Everyone who came to my shows, and walked up to tell me what the songs meant to them. I'm thanking them all with this record.""</p><p>Ruben's story begins in the heart of a musical family. His father and grandfather were both professional musicians, performing at weddings, Bar Mitzvahs, corporate events and other gatherings in Philadelphia and its environs. Ruben recalls watching in awe as his dad's band rehearsed rock, pop and R&amp;B hits. He began taking piano lessons, but lost interest during his adolescence. ""I had told myself I couldn't play guitar because that was my dad's instrument,"" he notes. ""Then I realized how stupid that was."" His father bought him a cheap guitar with the promise of a better instrument if he made progress; the guitar felt right in Jesse's hands, and by age 16 he was writing songs.</p><p>The artist cites singer-songwriters like Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell and James Taylor as his greatest influences, but also admits a fondness for the standards penned by Cole Porter and the Gershwins. While he's loath to compare himself to his idols, he says he takes courage in their stories. ""Paul Simon wasn't always hailed as a genius,"" he points out. ""At first, he was a 20-year-old kid with a guitar who dreamed up these incredibly ambitious songs. Realizing that helped me give myself permission to write what I wanted to write.""</p><p>He only applied to one college: Berklee College of Music in Boston. His first year there was a struggle, as he plunked out rudimentary solos in guitar classes filled with fusion-shredding virtuosos. But once he was able to focus on songwriting, Ruben blossomed; regular gigging soon followed. ""By the time I graduated,"" he points out, ""I was on the road pretty much every weekend.""</p><p>As a live performer he racked up odd experiences like playing backyard barbecues, singing at a daytime Sweet 16 party, and even serenading a couple of fans on their anniversary (he showed up in their kitchen with his guitar, at the woman's bidding, to surprise her boyfriend). The gigs gradually got bigger, and soon Ruben was paying his rent with engagements across the East Coast - becoming adept at getting around by commuter rail, booking cheap flights, promoting his shows and maintaining contact with fans via Facebook, his blog and the comments on his YouTube video posts.</p><p>The online community also came in handy when he was recording his debut album. ""I had no money, and five of my friends held a Facebook fundraiser for me,"" he reports. ""They presented me with a giant check for $2,500 on my twenty-first birthday."" And though elements of this initial effort seem distant to him now, Ruben credits Honesty with giving him a leg up in building his audience; in addition to the brisk sales of his debut, he continues to enjoy rapturous fan feedback about its songs.</p><p>Upon graduating from Berklee in 2008, Ruben was already living out of a suitcase in his battle-tested Toyota. ""If I had my choice, I'd be touring all the time,"" he volunteers. ""I love the lifestyle - sleeping late and getting up and driving and playing and meeting a bunch of people and doing the same thing the next day. I love not having to worry about cleaning my room or doing dishes; I'm cool with living out of a suitcase; I'm just working toward the day when I can trade the Greyhound for a bus of my own.""</p><p>""I'm staying out of New York for a while,"" Ruben sings in ""A Lack of Armor,"" although that self-imposed exile may soon be coming to an end, as the singer-songwriter plans a move to the Empire State from his temporary base in Nashville. But for the time being, Ruben's true home is the road - where he'll no doubt continue to touch lives, have offbeat adventures and add new names to the ever-growing list of The Ones That Matter.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/jesserubenmusic"" target=""_blank"">Jesse Ruben MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Potentials are a rock band that originally formed in Fairfax, Virginia.

Recorded in 2005, it is the album that all Bleu fans want to own, but almost never could. A WATCHED POT was originally recorded for Aware/Columbia Records as a follow up to Bleu's critically-aclaimed 2003 record Redhead. NPR listed Redhead as one of the Top 10 records of the year, and during that time Bleu was touring with hit acts like John Mayer, Switchfoot, and Ryan Adams and wowing crowds across the country with his unique songs and passionate performances.</p><p>Only a few weeks after the final tracks of A WATCHED POT were recorded, Bleu was dropped from the label along with dozens of other acts and employees involved in Sony's ongoing downsizing. But instead of accepting defeat, Bleu continued to play these new songs for his devoted fan base while working tirelessly to get his record released from his former label. He also took the opportunity to pursue many other creative adventures.</p><p>Moving from Boston to Los Angeles in 2006, Bleu released a side-project CD L.E.O. Alpacas Orgling (a power-pop collective with friends like Andy Sturmer of Jellyfish, Steve Gorman of The Black Crowes and Jason Scheff of Chicago), as well as starting The Major Labels (a power-pop band with Mike Viola and Ducky Carlisle), and LoudLion (a pop-metal homage featuring members of Rooney, The Donnas, and Bang Camaro, amongst others). LA also proved to be the perfect place for Bleu to pursue his burgeoning career as a professional songwriter and producer, but releasing A WATCHED POT never faded from the forefront of his creative goals. And...with a little (well, a lot of) persistence, he finally acquired the rights to material that Bleu describes as being at his creative heart and soul. Bleu says ""these songs are my emotional progeny. I think they represent an honest record of the fears and heartache, as well as the hope and fantasies that encircled me during that chaotic time in my life.""</p><p>The here and now finds Bleu at the top of his game. In the past few years he has had numerous songs cut by top-acts like the Jonas Brothers, Boys Like Girls, Hanson, Kate Veogele, Jon McLaughlin and Evan Taubenfeld, who's first single is his adaptation of Bleu's fan-favorite (and A WATCHED POT highlight track) ""Boy Meets Girl."" He's recently played shows with friends like Mike Viola and Rooney, and is booked to hit all of his major markets and then some in support of A WATCHED POT.</p><p>With an album full of soaring melodies, meticulously crafted productions and sincere, yet inventive lyrics, Bleu fans will wait no more for this pot to boil....""It truly means the world to me to finally get this record released. It always feels good to put your art out in to the world, but after all I've gone through for this material to see the light of day, the reward is particularly sweet.""</p><p>In the fall of 2009, Bleu is preparing for another round of shows in Los Angeles, Boston, NYC and Nashville, plus this year��_��__��_��__��_��__s power-pop festival in Charlotte, NC.</p><p>Bleu will begin work writing for Mom'n'Pop Records (Michael Goldstone) recently signed band TV/TV from NYC.

Soaring guitar solos reminiscent of Queen - jagged, angular rhythm guitar progressions reminiscent of early The Kinks rock anthems - vocal harmonies that call back to the Zombies - Pop sensible, catchy hook songwriting that reminds of Elvis Costello; in short, Nunchucks are building upon the best Classic Rock that current generations miss out on.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/wearenunchucks"" target=""_blank"">Nunchucks MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",6379,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,8/6/10 22:00John Eddie,,,0,,"<p><strong>LATE SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.<br /></em></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5756,$15 advance/ $18 day of show,,8/6/10 0:00The Lydia Finale: A Goodbye & Farewell Tour,River City Extension,,0,Analog Rebellion,"<p><strong>EARLY SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/playradioplay"" target=""_blank"">Analog Rebellion MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A cup of warm milk is easier then a lullaby, softer then a blanket.

In the book ""The Giver"" by Lois Lowry, the main character lives in a black and white world. When he is chosen to take on the responsibility of the hopes, thoughts, and feelings of his entire village, he finally begins to see in color. The name is a metaphor because one of the most important goals of our music is to create a connection with the listener by accurately connecting the stories and ideas contained in our music in a way that allows the listener to take and interpret the songs as their own. This way, the listener is just as important as the artist.

Songs are massive combining heavy guitars, shot-gun drums, extraordinary bass lines, endless harmonies, and unforgettable hooks. Influences are varied (Stones, JET, Foo, Queen, QOTSA, Zeppelin, Beatles) but not overt or overdone as each song is performed via the musical talents of four very different rock and roll souls - from a Berklee trained bass player and trumpet-trained lead guitar player, to a self-taught country picker and a drummer from a marching band. This rare mix of rock'n'rolla's produces powerful tracks that give listeners' multiple influences in every song. The band's first studio album, Stay Gold Sessions (available @ iTunes and CD Baby), was a stripped down, self-produced affair recorded live in early 2007 in an attempt to capture the band's raw energy and pop hooks. Stay Gold Sessions was followed up by multiple live performances including the 2008 and 2009 Shamrock Festivals in Washington DC (DC area's biggest St. Patrick's Day Festival). After more live performances in the summer of 2009, the boys put touring on hold to record their second album. The new record, Raven Nevermore, is out now (CDBABY.com) and features 11 critically acclaimed original rock and roll tracks.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/odst"" target=""_blank"">Overdrive Superthruster MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",6080,$10 ,,7/22/10 23:30The Greencards,,,0,,"<p><strong>EARLY SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5598,$18 ,,7/21/10 22:30Between the Trees - cancelled,Mark Rose (of Spitalfield),,0,Camera Can't Lie,"<p><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>This show has been cancelled.

Fortunately for the members of Camera Can't Lie, rock and roll found them.</p><p>Camera is comprised of high school friends Eric Arjes (Vocals/Guitar), Kyle Lindsay (Bass), and hard-hitting drummer Josh Bendell. ""When you live in a small town, there's not always exciting things to do. While our friends were out partying, playing sports, and studying, we were practicing. Everyday."" says Arjes.</p><p>Although, the majority of the band originally comes from classical music backgrounds - symphonies, jazz ensembles, and choirs - their biggest musical inspiration has been 90's radio. ""I wasn't allowed to listen to rock radio when I was growing up, so like all rebellious kids I would come home, sneak into my room and do it anyway,"" laughs Arjes. ""I didn't do it to be disobedient. I did it because there was something in that music that I couldn't find anywhere else."" The rest of the band holds similar childhood memories whether it be making mix tapes of their favorite songs off the radio or sneaking out of the house to see Blink 182's Dollar Bill Tour.</p><p>The rock group from Minneapolis shares love for more than their musical influences - which range from Third-Eye Blind to the Goo Goo Dolls. They also love being on the road, a nice round of golf, hanging out with the best fans in the world, spending quality time with their families and friends, and their hometown Minnesota Twins. Philanthropists through and through, the band recorded and donated an acoustic version of Radiohead's ""High &amp; Dry"" to benefit the Invisible Children organization. In addition, they were part of the ""Go Green"" tour, sharing a van and backline with other groups to reduce their environmental impact.</p><p>The band signed to Atlantic Records in the spring of 2008 and spent that summer touring and writing for their debut album. In January 2009 they left the ice-cold-freezer-box they call home and headed to the warmth of Ron Aniello's studio in Los Angeles. Aniello's previous work on bands such as Lifehouse and Guster made him a perfect choice to shape the album that the band envisioned. ""I spent a lot of time with Ron prior to starting this project and the chemistry between us, both artist to producer and artist to artist, was amazing,"" comments Arjes. ""I felt inspired and motivated to be a better guitarist, singer and songwriter. He pushed us further than we've ever gone.""</p><p>Camera tracked almost twenty songs for this record, some of which will be used on a promotional EP, available in October. ""These songs are an accumulation of the last five years of our lives. I think that's why we are so attached to what we've created and why it's impossible to peg this album with just one theme. This album is, in so many words, about finding hope in chaos, focusing on the present, speaking with actions instead of words, putting your heart on the line, dealing with internal struggle, and risking the safe and the comfortable for a chance at greatness. It is a play-by-play of our journey as a band, and we couldn't be more proud.""</p><p>The outcome? A five song EP entitled ""Days &amp; Days"" coming out October 2009 and the forthcoming debut full-length album in 2010!</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/cameracantlie"" target=""_blank"">Camera Can't Lie MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mark Rose is a singer/songwriter from Chicago, IL who plays his own blend of blues infused rock &amp; pop.

Composed of Dan Miller (Acoustic and Electric Guitar, Vocals), John Beck (Bass), and Max Harwood (Drums), the band is based out of the Washington DC area and has been playing together at bars, clubs and house parties on the east coast since 2007. A big part of the band's success can be attributed to the fact that all three have been best friends since their elementary school days, and thus have a healthy dynamic from which to build upon. The group prides themself on attracting a diverse audience, and composing music that contains as much intellect to contemplate as it does rhythm to move to.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/missionsouth"" target=""_blank"">Mission South MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Joel Pomerantz of the Songwriters Association of Washington has described singer/songwriter Alexe Colbus as having a ""pure, mature voice and clever songwriting skills."" Colbus has had music in her blood since the day she was born. After putting on a show in her cul-de-sac at five years old singing ""Big Spender"" it was evident the stage was her second home and that Colbus was born to perform. She flourished in elementary school talent shows, graduated to talent competitions in high school, and quickly became identified as the ""girl who sang the National Anthem"" at various high school sporting events. Singing the National Anthem also led her to perform at George Mason's Patriot Center in front of over 6,000 people but Colbus had more to offer than just a voice. At the age of fourteen she started to teach herself the piano and in just two years time she had taught herself enough to start writing songs. She signed with the independent record label, New Indie Artists, in March of 2006 and since then has performed at local venues such as Jammin' Java and in several venues in New York City. Colbus' debut CD can be purchased on iTunes and she is currently in the studio working on production of a second album.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/alexecolbus"" target=""_blank"">Alexe Colbus MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anybody can program an album, put themselves up on iTunes and call it a day as an artist, but it still takes energy and talent to put on a live show people want to cross state lines to come see. Founded on the ideals of the working bands of decades past and driven by the love performing, Prettier In Person focuses on delivering fun and exciting rock n roll to the bars and clubs, providing an explosive and energetic performance that begs a crowd's participation.</p><p>Fans have compared the trio's sound to Queens of the Stone Age, AC/DC, the White Stripes, and Nirvana, among others. However, like most pretentious artists, the band tries to avoid specific labels, simply preferring to call themselves a rock band due to their wide ranging sound that touches on everything from alternative to hard rock.</p><p>After cutting their teeth with a few very successful shows over the summer and sharing the stage with local favorites Ballyhoo and The War Within, the band plans to work on a much-demanded EP this holiday season.

This frenetic foursome from Washington D.C. provides a refreshing musical outlet, especially to those looking for something out of the ordinary. Since 2008, the boys from Kid Architect have been cultivating their own unique brand of experimental rock. Driven by heavy piano, ethereal guitars, and a versatile rhythm section, Kid Architect delivers an explosive, clean, and undeniably catchy sound. Fronted by singer and keyboardist Thom Bridgwood, the band continues to propel their reputation up and down the east coast with powerful performances and a clear passion for life and music.</p><p>The combination of Kid Architect's professionalism and creativity provides the band with the perfect foundation upon which they continue to grow their fan base. Eager to rock the local music scene, Kid Architect wasted no time in writing, recording, and self-releasing their first four-song EP, ""PhilosoRaptor,"" in March 2009. In slightly over a year, the band has distributed over 1,000 copies of their EP to receptive audiences in the DC, Maryland, and Virginia area. Since then, Kid Architect has been featured in a variety of local media outlets such as On Tap magazine, Washingtonian magazine's online entertainment blog ""After Hours"", the Arlington Examiner, as well as an interview and radio play on WEBR Fairfax Radio. The band has successfully left a positive impression on the local music scene, catching the attention of fans, listeners, and media throughout the area.</p><p>The band is currently in the studio recording their highly anticipated debut full-length album and expects The Great Pretend to be released in September 2010.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/kidarchitect"" target=""_blank"">Kid Architect MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Punch Drunk Poets ""PDP"" is a DC-based alternative rock quartet with a soulful yet psychedelic approach to rock. With a fresh approach to lyric-writing and an ear for eclectically melodic and rhythmic tunes, these nouveau feel-rock pioneers are building a completely new sound that still manages to be reminiscent of the glory days of songwriting and music. The band can certainly be described as having an original sound. Intricate rhythm and lead sections mixed with lyrics addressing subjects of depth and philosophical introspection, as well as fictional stories with humorous connotations will fulfill your musical desires.</p><p>In March 09, after two years under the radar and an intense creative cycle, PDP released its debut album ""Another State of Mind"", produced by industry-veteran Jim Ebert (Butch Walker, Meredith Brooks, Cowboy Mouth, Marvelous 3, Niki Barr). The album is a refreshingly eclectic palette of rock, sporting raw poetic ballads in the traditions of Jeff Buckley and The Doors as well as raucous hard rock in the spirit of Soundgarden and The Red Hot Chili Peppers.</p><p>Having released their first album, PDP now is poised to build upon its live presence in the music scene as well as mastering the art of creating a sound of depth and accessibility by listeners. The band is currently engaged in yet another extensive creative cycle in preparation for a sophomore album, and gearing up for a small east-coast tour.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/punchdrunkpoets"" target=""_blank"">Punch Drunk Poets MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/ellenwinter"" target=""_blank"">Ellen Winter MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",6416,$8 advance/ $12 at the door,,7/19/10 23:30Steel Train,Girl In A Coma,,0,Yawn,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/yawntheband"" target=""_blank"">Yawn MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p><p>Girl in a Coma, hailing from the Lone Star State, formed when best friends Jenn Alva and Phanie Diaz met in Jr-high school art class over a mutual love of the Smiths, Nirvana, and skipping school. All they needed was a singer. Enter Nina Diaz, Phanie's then 12-year old little sister. Nina blew them away with her mesmerizing vocals, a powerful voice some critics have compared to Bjork, Patsy Cline, and the band's hero, Morrissey himself. The trio practiced for three years, gigged at local punk rock clubs, played a High School talent show, one kid's birthday party, and then hit the road, building up a solid and loyal fan base across the country.</p><p>In 2006, the Girls played for Joan Jett and long-time songwriting partner and producer, Kenny Laguna, at New York's Knitting Factory as part of a cable TV show featuring unknown bands. Jett and Laguna were so impressed with the band that they signed GIAC to their label, Blackheart Records, on the spot. The band's 2007 debut album, Both Before I'm Gone, was a critical hit with raves from Alternative Press Magazine, the LA Weekly, Bust magazine, among many others, with the album reaching No. 23 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart and No. 21 on iTunes. ""Clumsy Sky,"" the band's first single, won a 2007 Independent Music Award in the Best Song-Punk category. The last of the four singles released, ""Their Cell,"" was recently voted by TV viewers into the Top 10 on Logo's The Click List show.</p><p>Since the CD's release GIAC has been headlining shows in venues coast-to-coast, playing on Cyndi Lauper's ""True Colors"" tour, as well as opening for the Pogues, Social Distortion, Tegan and Sara in a cross-country national tour, and with Morrissey in both Europe and the U.S.</p><p>In between the constant touring, the band was busy writing songs for their new CD, the upcoming Blackheart Record's release Trio B.C. The creative process was a new and liberating experience for the Girls.</p><p>""The challenge for this record was having to come up with songs in a matter of a year,"" Jenn explains, ""with Both Before I'm Gone we had 7 years with that material. For this new CD, a little over 18 months.""</p><p>As with their first album, the end result is a unique amalgamation of eclectic influences: oldies, rockabilly, 90s alternative, and contemporary bands both indie and mainstream. And in a nod to their San Antonio, Texas background, the Girls place their cutting-edge rock sound in a familiar context.</p><p>""We chose Trio B.C. as the album title because it was the name of our grandfather's Tejano band way back in the 50s,"" Phanie Diaz explains. ""He was our first musical influence. He would play us guitar and sing and we would love to watch him in the garage with a cold beer in his hand playing his records and singing along like he meant it. His passion is our inspiration. We hope to make people feel that way about our music.""</p><p>Trio B.C. includes tracks produced by Grammy-award winning producer Greg Collins (U2 and Gwen Stefani) and Gabriel Gonzalez (formerly of Sparta and one of the producers of the band's debut Both Before I'm Gone). Joan Jett and Kenny Laguna produced two special tracks on the CD, ""Vino,"" and ""Joannie in the City,"" a snarling, post-punk rock cut featuring Joan Jett on guitar along with Jett's distinct vocals on background.</p><p>""The song is about females in the music business,"" Girl in a Coma's writer/singer Nina Diaz explains about her song, ""having that tough attitude and doing what you want. Joan was the door opener for us all.""</p><p>The rest of the album's cuts explore different styles and tempos with tracks ranging from the eerie and poetic love song ""El Monte"" to the fast and hard rocking ""Static Mind."" Other tracks include the delicate ballad ""Pink Lemonade"" and the more sonically experimental ""Ven Cerca,"" Girl in a Coma's first Spanish language song, a cover of a bright 1960s Mexican pop song, but made modern and dissonant with feedback and fuzzy guitars reminiscent of Sonic Youth at their grungiest best.</p><p>When not on the road Phanie likes to Ghost Hunt. Jenn paints pictures. And Nina has a stuffed bear named G&uuml;enther.

Since it's conception in 2003, the Nashville-based, piano-fronted indie rock quartet is building a better city with perfect song-craft, highly energetic performances, and a hearty work ethic. Since the sold-out show for their sophomore release, Everything is Working Out Fine in Some Town (2008), these charmingly handsome brunettes have been touring the U.S. coast to coast for two years now and have built up quite a loyal following in the process. It's the good looks really, though.</p><p>D.C. natives Josh Foster (vocals/piano), Tom Gilbert (guitar/vocals), and Ben Jacoby (drums) deposited themselves into Nashville just a year before releasing Everything is Working Out, and work out it did. The guys settled in place after discovering Tennessee music man Andrew Samples (bass/vocals). Foster's soaring voice and detailed compositions are the perfect home for Gilbert's unique, artistic style on guitar, and Samples' driving bass sparks a fire under Jacoby, setting ablaze a well-matched rhythm section.</p><p>New songs are now pouring out of them! Their latest single, No Comfort, was released in January 2010, kicking off another whole year of touring. The single features two new songs recorded with Nashville producer Derek Garten, whom the band worked with on the previous record.</p><p>The new sound is a step ahead in the right direction. Foster's lyrics remain heartfelt while the music becomes stronger. It is original and well-rehearsed; they're so tight you'd swear they were all wearing girdles. These guys are having fun, no doubt about it, and there isn't another band in Nashville more ready to be taken seriously.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/parachutemusical"" target=""_blank"">Parachute Musical MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Doesn't the world have enough ""the"" bands?<br />It does now.</p><p>First planted in the cranium of guitarist and singer/songwriter Dan Goldberger in 1989, The Independent grew into a full-grown band at the end of 2008. Taking a cup of pop, a spoonful of jazz, a drop of folk, and baking it in an oven of ROCK, The Independent concocts songs so infectious you might get a rash, in a style best-termed ""pop-fusion"". A sip of sonic experimentation and improvisation complements the sound nicely in the live environment, but never at the expense of putting a smile on your face and the songs in your heart.

""Old soul"" is more like it-if you consider the classic pop stylings of 30 or 35 years ago; the remnants from another lifetime, as they literally are for this 22-year-old singer/songwriter. Growing up, Kaprelian gravitated toward the rock classics her musician father schooled her in.</p><p>""I'm definitely an old soul when it comes to music,"" she says. I grew up only listening to all those records my dad would play in the house, from Queen to Paul McCartney to Sting. My dad used to play Billy Joel songs to put me to sleep. Asked what 21st century artists she listens to, she reels off Mika, Coldplay, Sheryl Crow, Alicia Keys, and John Mayer-basically, all the contemporary artists who are as steeped in the great music of the &lsquo;70s as she is.</p><p>As proud as Kaprelian is of the musical heritage passed down by her parents, she has at least as much pride in her ethnic heritage. ""I'm 75% Armenian, and I have a little bit of Irish blood in me, too; my dad's half. We speak the language at home, and it's a part of my everyday life."" But her first language might have been music. She sang before she could talk, singing ""Happy Birthday"" to herself at the age of 1.</p><p>""I started writing songs when I was 14, but I didn't play anything. So I started playing piano to be able to put down the melodies that I was already writing and singing into a little recorder."" She had no formal training and picked the instrument up by ear. Even when she began to be more accomplished, her musical aspirations were unknown to her classmates. ""I definitely wouldn't talk about my music at school. I didn't go to any of the high school parties. I would do my homework and do all my AP classes, go to the studio, go to sleep. That was my entire life-along with classical ballet, which I was very into. I'm proud to say I wasn't one of the cool kids.""</p><p>Kaprelian has a classic story of being discovered more or less at random. Actually, she's got two or three of those stories. Her first discovery came at age 15, when a talent scout tapped her on the shoulder at her local mall after watching her sing with a school group for a fundraising event. One contact led to another until, right as she was about to go off to UC Berkeley at age 18, she was instead personally signed to a major label by one of the world's most famous record company chiefs.</p><p>That particular fairy tale was not her destiny. That would-be debut album was scrapped and Kaprelian and her former label parted ways. Then, in odds akin to being hit by lightning twice, she got discovered more or less off the street again.</p><p>Mindful that some other singers had broken through with covers, Kaprelian's producer suggested that she film herself doing a solo cover of OneRepublic's ""Apologize"" to post on YouTube. ""He said, &lsquo;You've always liked Ryan's style of writing, and it's piano-based. What have you got to lose?' Soon after, she learned OneRepublic was sponsoring a contest to see who could do the best cover of ""Apologize,"" so she uploaded it. Weeks later, she was getting twin messages from people at Interscope-one informing her that she'd won the contest, and another inviting her to come in for a meeting.</p><p>And here's where she really rolled a seven: ""Honestly, I feel so lucky, because Interscope let me make the record I wanted to make. My A&amp;R guy was like, &lsquo;Do what you want. I trust you.'"" The rewards of that mutual faith are abundant.</p><p>Her core recording band included well-known players Abe Laboriel and Matt Chamberlin on drums, Chris Chaney on bass, and Lyle Workman on guitar. That the album would also have some orchestration was a given-I wanted the record to sound very rich and lush and full. And there are barely any synths on the record. I wanted everything live.""</p><p>The strings are usually used for seasoning, but they become altogether prominent on the song ""March Mornings."" Kaprelian says: ""No other instrumentation aside from the strings and a vocal. I really wanted people to hear my voice. When you have a song that has a much bigger arrangement, like &lsquo;New Day' or &lsquo;Sinner or a Saint,' you can't tell if I can really sing or not. In &lsquo;March Mornings,' you can hear the quality of my voice, and that was the goal for that song-aside from trying to model it after one of my favorite Beatles songs.""</p><p>Lyrically, though, ""March Mornings"" couldn't be any more different from the lonesome ""Eleanor Rigby."" It's a song of ebullient, newfound hope, and-not coincidentally-the first song she wrote after signing her deal with Interscope, ""about how incredibly excited I was about the whole situation.""</p><p>""New Day"" is also a profoundly positive song, but with a slightly darker lyrical edge; it was written after Kaprelian lost her previous label deal and before she signed the new one, when she was struggling to maintain faith in her musical path. That first single, which was prominently featured at the climax of an episode of MTV's The Hills, was written ""about how completely unhappy I was, and really about struggling, persevering, and being in a situation where you don't know how you're gonna dig yourself out of it. And at the end of it, life is like a road-you don't stop in the middle of it. I really want people to listen to this record and get a sense of hope from it.""</p><p>Kaprelian veers darker in ""Should Have Known Better,"" which is ""definitely about someone who did me wrong and led me in the wrong direction. Had I not gone through that experience, I wouldn't have written the record that I wrote."" ""Raw"" is a pure lost-love song sent out ""for every angry female who's ever been wronged by a man.""</p><p>But that rage is the exception, and not the rule, on an album that has more tender than raging moments. ""Purified,"" for instance, is ""my &lsquo;You've Got a Friend' moment. I remember listening to Carole King's Tapestry over and over and over again. I wrote it about my producer, Xandy Barry, who stood by my side and said &lsquo;I believe in you. We're gonna do this together. And I will spend as much time with you as I need to, to help you get to this next step.'"" The bulk of the album's tracks were produced by Xandy Barry and longtime associate Wally Gagel. On ""Sinner and a Saint,"" she collaborated with Tedder. Bandmate Brent Kutzle produced ""Three Simple Words,"" a non-album,  iTunes-exclusive single.</p><p>The ten songs on Kaprelian's debut album are full of dashed hopes, fierce renewal, and proud vulnerability. The singer expects to bond with a younger audience, but has already been surprised at how her music clicks with listeners of a certain age, too-which maybe should be no surprise at all, given its lyrical depth and roots in rock classicism. By the end of the album, listeners both young and old are certain to feel the emotional connection. Or, as she said, ""Spend a couple hours and we're all best friends."" How was it that a piano woman from another generation once put it? Oh yeah: You've got a BFF.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/tamarkaprelian"" target=""_blank"">Tamar Kaprelian MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",5882,$12 ,,7/6/10 23:30Todd Wright's 40x40 Finale Show,Scott Simons,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.<br /></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>40 songs in 40 weeks before the age of 40... 40x40 ends Wednesday, July 7th with the release of the 40th song and a celebration/ show that night at my favorite venue in the world.

After forming the band in late 2007 and recording their debut Self-Titled EP in Los Angeles, California, Safety Word Orange moved back to their hometown of Richmond, Virginia to continue the movement they started out west.</p><p>Safety Word Orange was formed when lead singer James Mason met guitarist Robbie Rusbuldt in Los Angeles in late 2007. Upon returning to Virginia they began searching for a more permanent line-up. The first addition was guitarist Jackson Wise, followed by Reid Taylor on the bass and Travis King on drums.</p><p>In 2008 SWO was named ""Indie Artist of the Year"" by Music Emissions who said, ""Safety Word Orange has a great start here; they have the ability to write power-pop songs that have a feel good vibe."" Their pop-rock instrumentals are the foundation behind lead singer James Mason's Third Eye Blind-esque vocals, backed by the clear tones of both Wise and Rusbuldt. ""With as much musicianship as you can handle, Safety Word Orange is one of the best bands you've never heard."" says Starpulse.com.</p><p>In January 2010, Safety Word Orange finished recording their second record, ""On Your Mark, Get Set..."" at Red Wire Audio with acclaimed producer Bryan Russell (Straylight Run, Envy On the Coast) The record is set for release on May 18, 2010.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/safetywordorange"" target=""_blank"">Safety Word Orange MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/boyswillbeboys"" target=""_blank"">Boys Will Be Boys MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5911,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,7/2/10 2:00Rites of Ash CD Release,Along Those Lines,,0,w/ DJ I-Dee,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/djidee"" target=""_blank"">DJ I-Dee MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With a quaint hometown attitude and an explosive stage show, Along Those Lines has been hailed as one of the best new acts.

Fears, doubts, loneliness, anger, regrets. Everyone can identify with these themes. That's where our music originates, but we transform that dark cloud into empowerment.  Fight the Lion does not dwell on the negativity, we confront it.  We conquer it.  When you're overwhelmed by those dark clouds, Fight the Lion will save you from defeat.  If you're surrounded by enemies, Fight the Lion is the cavalry charge.  When you find yourself in the fight of your life, Fight the Lion is the sound of victory.</p><p>All the members of Fight the Lion bring something to the battle, and they're all hungry for some action.  From Jake's soaring vocals in ""Don't Runaway,"" to Ron's guitar wizardry in ""Burn Out"", from Shawn's arresting rhythms in ""Let This Die"", to Jason's guard-dog-on-a-chain ferocity in ""Longshot"", these guys are on a mission of rock and roll vengeance.  They bring that mission to the stage with a frenetic energy.  And when it seems that they've lost control, that you're about to witness unhinged chaos, they execute perfect musical transitions that punctuate the thunder with silence and empty space.</p><p>On their debut full length album, ""When the Mighty Fall,"" Fight the Lion adeptly transitions from the title track's epic ballad to the full-throttle rock of ""Fire it Up"".  With songs like ""Let This Die"" and ""A New Hope"", they paint an intricate musical scene with complex harmonies and rhythms.  If that's a little too heavy, ""Don't Runaway"" and ""The Drive"" score big with an Americana-rock sound and irresistible vocals.  And if it's not heavy enough, ""Longshot"" hits like a savage punch to the gut.  Fight the Lion crosses multiple genres, but always delivers killer melodies, masterful guitar work, and flawless rhythms.</p><p>Fight the Lion's diverse sound has been compared to Coheed &amp; Cambria, Muse, Van Halen, Led Zeppelin, and Soundgarden.</p><p><a href=""http://www.fightthelion.com/"" target=""_blank"">Fight the Lion Website</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5888,$10 ,,6/24/10 23:00Beatlegras,,,0,,"<p><strong>EARLY SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be seated.</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5415,$20 ,,6/23/10 23:30Meg Hutchinson + Devon Sproule,,,5822,,"<p><strong>EARLY SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>""I asked God for a good job.

Perhaps a hint of homesickness is understandable.  Not only did Ms. Sproule spend much of the last two years touring abroad, her new album -- produced by husband Paul Curreri and featuring the pedal steel playing of the legendary BJ Cole -- was recorded, for the most part, in England.</p><p>""Last year was a good one,"" Sproule says, ""and full of adventures.  I drove myself all the way from Scotland on the left side of the road for a radio show.  I learned the intro to ""Johnny B. Goode"" before 8am in a Spanish hotel.  I even smoked a J with Lucinda Williams and kept my cool.""</p><p>""Musically,"" she continues, ""after a whole summer of festivals in the UK, my band was feeling great.  Everything was.  It wasn't even raining that much!  It would've been a shame not to capture something from that time, to let that phase of our playing evaporate into the next.  So we booked this studio out in the country.""</p><p>Continuing in the tradition of her previous works, &iexcl;Don't Hurry for Heaven! sports a variety of sonic influences: the title track -- a tipsy, twangy, spousal nudge -- wears a cowboy boot on one foot, and another on its head.  The great Jesse Winchester, a fellow Southerner (and hero of Sproule's), makes a cameo on the uber-groovy ""Ain't That the Way.""  Sproule and Curreri even duet on a left-field, desert-bluesy version of Black Uhuru's ""Sponji Reggae.""</p><p>Devon Sproule's last record, 2007's Keep Your Silver Shined proved an indie hit in the US, UK, Ireland and Europe.  Sproule toured with Woodstock legend Richie Havens, Lambchop frontman Kurt Wagner, and supported back-to-back nights in London with Lucinda Williams.</p><p>""Sproule's vocal and lyrical beauty is unmatched.""<em> -Rolling Stone</em></p><p>""Keep Your Silver Shined is one of the most fetching roots records to come down the pike in quite some time."" <em>-Philadelphia Inquirer </em></p><p>""These songs are beautiful, timeless and transporting."" <em>-Davy Rothbart of This American Life</em></p><p>""Vintage country...with jazzy sophistication..."" <em>-BBC</em></p><p>""Keep Your Silver Shined is a marvelous collection of songs and, frankly, it evokes a sense of place better than any album since Lucinda Williams' 1999 masterpiece Car Wheels on a Gravel Road."" <em>-All Music Guide </em></p><p><a href=""http://www.devonsproule.com"" target=""_blank"">Devon Sproule Website</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5823,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,6/22/10 23:00Jer Coons,Andrew Hoover,,0,Taylor Carson,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.<br /></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Taylor Carson hails from the land of the Dave Matthews Band, Virginia Coalition and O.A.R. While he built his musical chops on the shoulders of these acoustic rock superstars, his lyrical inspiration comes from timeless wordsmiths like Paul Simon, Cat Stevens and Martin Sexton.<br />Fresh off performances at the Dewey Beach Music Festival,&nbsp;the APCA National Conference, and Pat McGee's Down The Hatch Festival he will release his&nbsp;new 16 track epic record, Defending The Name, in September 2010.</p><p><a href=""http://www.taylorcarson.com/"" target=""_blank"">Taylor Carson Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Twenty-two-year-old singer/songwriter/guitarist Andrew Hoover brings to the table a pot full of home cooked acoustic soul, R&amp;B, and blues, stirred together with some tasty flamenco and colorful pop sprinkles.  Which isn't surprising, really, since he originally trained to be a chef.</p><p>At age 14, Hoover apprenticed for two years with chefs at a AAA four-diamond restaurant in Connecticut in an effort to build his cooking knowledge base and really learn his way around a kitchen.  He catered parties on the side to earn some money and even considered attending culinary school, but a comment from his sister about learning to play the guitar sparked something inside of him that would decide his future.  Once Andrew picked up his first guitar he was hooked, and he started learning how to play the songs of his musical heroes.  Visions of Michelin stars faded a bit and were put on the back burner, and Hoover sought to learn the instrument inside and out, watching YouTube videos and concert DVD's in an attempt to pick up guitar-playing techniques.  <br />He started writing songs his senior year in high school, and started singing in college.  ""Around the end of my freshman year,"" Hoover explains, ""it really started to hit me that this was something I wanted to do.  I wanted to write songs and be a musician and make a living at it.""  By the time his sophomore year in college rolled around, he was spending all of his free time in the music practice rooms when he wasn't doing homework.  At the end of that year, with his parents' blessing, he quit school to follow his dream of making music full time.</p><p>He recorded his first EP in his garage, and self-released it in 2007.  Andrew mapped out and booked his own tour, which took him from Maine down to Florida and west to Chicago, hitting all of the points in between. ""I just wanted to play,"" Hoover remembers.  ""Anywhere I could find an audience, I was there. It was not just what I had to do to build a name for myself, but it was also what I wanted to do.""  A second solo acoustic EP soon followed to stoke his growing fan base.</p><p>Andrew caught the attention of Rock Ridge Music through the new ""old fashioned way"" of MySpace outreach, sending messages to fans of comparable artists.  Rock Ridge staffer Carly Kent received one of Andrew's messages, and liked what she heard enough to catch a show in New York.  Blown away by what she saw, Kent passed along Andrew's demo to label President Jason Spiewak.  Skeptical as always, Spiewak listened and was impressed.  It was one of Hoover's YouTube videos that cemented Spiewak's interest.  ""Andrew Hoover is a show-stopping entertainer.  He draws people in with his percussive, unique style of guitar playing and makes them fall in love with his unbelievable voice.""</p><p>Hoover signed with Rock Ridge Music in 2008, and hit the studio with Spiewak in New York City to record his full-length debut.  In addition to the NYC sessions, Andrew traveled South to work with Chris Henderson of 3 Doors Down fame at his Rivergate Studios in Hendersonville, Tennessee.  The result is Hoover's full-band debut album, ""Chances, Stances &amp; Romances,"" which will be released on September 22, 2009.</p><p>Andrew is a solo musician, though he voices several instruments in his live shows.  His unique slap guitar style carries inspirations from the bass and percussion instruments, giving his songs a groove and rhythm not often associated with singer-songwriters.  His vocal style is raw and original, colorful, and dynamic.  Andrew takes his cues from a variety of his heroes including but not limited to Stevie Wonder, Otis Redding, Marc Broussard, Ray LaMontagne, Raul Midon, James Morrison, and Martin Sexton.</p><p>Andrew kicked off 2010 by performing on Sixthman's The Rock Boat sharing the stage with artists such as Marc Broussard, Will Hoge, Stephen Kellogg &amp; The Sixers, Tyrone Wells, and Augustana. Throughout 2010 he will continue to tour to promote 'Chances, Stances &amp; Romances'  and build on a touring history that already includes previous performances in support of Sister Hazel, Elliott Yamin, Tim Reynolds, Dave Barnes, Ernie Halter, Ari Hest, the Alternate Routes, and Kate Voegele.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/andrewhoovermusic"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Hoover MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5970,$10 ,,6/21/10 23:30The Fold + McTwist,Jonas Sees In Color,,5913,Breaking Borders,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of Breaking Borders began inside the minds of lead singer Will Ruben and lead guitar player Nathan Kastner as they entered Thomas Wootton high school. This idea began to materialize with the two friends writing awful, acoustic, 3 doors down-esque songs that they recorded on garage band (For the record, those songs have since been deleted). But, it didn't matter how bad the songs were, they loved writing music and couldn't get enough. Kastner and Ruben had agreed that simply writing acoustic music wasn't enough anymore and decided to begin a band. This is when drummer Falon Lewis entered the picture. Her hard rock style blew the minds of the two friends and influenced them to adopt this style into their writing, giving birth to the harder style the band plays today. Next up began the search for an ever elusive bass player. After playing with a number of bassists, David Stark joined the lineup. He seemed to fit perfectly with group, adding with his jazzy style of play and good personality. The band played many shows that year including steady shows at Ram's Cycles, The Montgomery County battle of the bands, and the 9:30 club. The band also began recording an EP with producer Mark Williams (My Favorite Highway) who would later become their manager. After taking a short hiatus over the summer after their Freshman year, the band was back and ready to take on the world. This, however, is when Stark left the band on good terms due to personal reasons, leaving the band bass-less. With impending shows on the horizon, the band needed to find a bassist fast. This is when current rhythm guitarist Matt Oberdorfer and Bassist Justin Pugrant joined the crew. Oberdorfer was a childhood friend of Kastner and Ruben making him an easy find for the band. With him, Oberdorfer brought Pugrant, a classmate from St. Andrews Episcopal school, who fit in perfectly with the band. After only a few short weeks with this new lineup, the band played a showcase at Wootton high school, drawing a substantial crowd and wowing their audience. After this show the possibilities became endless. With many show opportunities being offered and the release of the EP imminent, the band was finally on their way to becoming a premier band of the area. The EP was released on MySpace in late November, awaiting the hard copy release in January. This is when the band was offered to play the Paradigm Destruction tour at the Bethesda Theatre. The event, to be held on January 9th, 2010, is gathering an incredible amount of attention, prompting advertisements featuring the bands music to be played on such premier radio stations as Hot 99.5 and DC 101. With this new-found publicity, premier line-up, and slowly growing following, the idea thought up in the minds of two kids had finally become a reality, and Breaking Borders continues to do just that.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/breakingborders"" target=""_blank"">Breaking Borders MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/jonasseesincolor"" target=""_blank"">Jonas Sees In Color MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>McTwist formed in summer of 2007, sharing a love of music, performing, road trips, sports and video games. The foursome is comprised of childhood friends who developed their craft by playing in various rock bands in the Maryland area. This experience during their formative years enabled the band to gain valuable stage experience while experimenting with a wide variety sounds. McTwist loves to put on a show. Their mix of humor and music is present in everything they do. Since their inception, McTwist has developed an unyielding work ethic, an unmistakable sound, and a dedicated fan base.</p><p>With the release of their debut album, Amateur Hour, McTwist has created a niche in the powerful Maryland and Northern Virginia music scenes. The album is an exemplar of what makes McTwist distinctive: powerful guitar, heartfelt lyricism, and a creative rhythm section. They play a brand of rock that is dedicated to being true to their wide-ranging influences, drawing from the genres of pop rock, punk, alternative rock, acoustic rock and surf rock. McTwist is as comfortable sweating and jumping through a two hour electric performance, as they are entering into a songwriter's circle and completely stripping down their music.

Their already constant touring schedule recently ballooned to include touring as part of the Fred Eaglesmith Band. Backing up the iconic Indie artist led to a collaboration with Eaglesmith's band in their opening sets. Eaglesmith was struck by the new band's rough, rawboned sound and invited them to record the new Fabulous Ginn Sisters CD in his Port Dover, Ontario studio. The result is a smoky, drunken stumble through a broken-heart junkyard. &lsquo;You Can't Take a Bad Girl Home' is set for release in the late winter of 2010. Having notched out a place for themselves with their amazing singing, the new CD is a marked dodge towards rock and roll. The songs are bleak yet poppy, the singing is subtle and nuanced, and the music is a garage mix of reverb and mystery hum. The Fabulous Ginn Sisters (then &lsquo;The Ginn Sisters') first made their mark on the Americana scene with their 2006 release ""Blood Oranges"" which received stellar reviews from regional, national and international media. It was played on Americana, AAA, Folk, Country, Eclectic, and even Bluegrass radio. It reached #2 on the RootsMusic Report, #3 on the FAR Chart and #24 on the Americana Chart. It was the #1 independently released CD on the Americana Chart for 2006. It was in top rotation on a number of national radio, TV-radio and Internet stations, including XM Radio's X Country. They have played in some of the best listening rooms in the country like The Ark, Mountain Stage, The Little Bear, The Bitter End, The Cactus Cafe, Eddies Attic, CSPS, the Focal Point, Swallow Hill, and the Bluebird Caf&eacute; and festivals including Big State, Kerrville, and Flat Rock. They are primarily interested in playing at festivals, music clubs, theatres and listening rooms.</p><p><a href=""http://www.theginnsisters.com/"" target=""_blank"">The Ginn Sisters Website</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5646,$20 ,,6/16/10 0:00Josh Hoge + Joe Firstman,Marianne Keith,,5772,,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>THE SO CAL BASED SINGER, SONGWRITER, AND RECENT<br />HOLLYWOOD MUSIC IN MEDIA (HMMA) AWARD NOMINEE HITS THE ROAD IN OCTOBER FOR A SOLO ACOUSTIC TOUR WITH SQUEEZE LEAD SINGER GLENN TILBROOK</p><p>The Multi-Talented Performer, Who Has Opened For Joe Bonamassa, Better Than Ezra, Ari Hest and Brett Dennen, Gears Up For the Early 2010 Release of &lsquo;CATHARTIC' The Highly Anticipated Follow Up To Her 2007 Debut &lsquo;Beautiful Distraction' On Unison Music Records<br />Marianne Keith's fans may have to wait till early 2010 for the release of her new album Cathartic, but they can catch her pouring her heart out-and sharing some of its emotionally compelling songs-long before then as she embarks on a ten city solo acoustic tour October 12 with Glenn Tilbrook, lead singer of the famed UK rock band Squeeze, that hits cities on both coasts.</p><p>The Redlands, California born and raised performer (www.mariannekeith.com), who launched her career playing clubs and coffeehouses in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange Counties, will join Tilbrook for shows in Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, L.A., Tucson, Austin, Houston, Dallas, New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia.</p><p>Capping a busy fall, on November 19, Marianne will find out if ""Kiss Me In The Rain,"" one of the most popular and infectious tracks from her 2007 critically acclaimed Unison Music Group debut Beautiful Distraction, wins the Hollywood Music in Media Award (HMMA) it was recently nominated for. The HMMA, which takes place at the Highlands Nightclub, located in the Hollywood &amp; Highland/Kodak Theater complex, honors the music of visual mediums, the talented individuals responsible for selecting it, and the music of artists, both mainstream and independent, from around the globe.</p><p>Since releasing her first album, the singer-who likes to describe her vibe as ""folk/pop/rock""--has shown her wide ranging appeal on tours with established and upcoming artists in a wide range of genres, including blues/rocker Joe Bonamassa, alt-rockers Better Than Ezra, singer/songwriters Ari Hest and Julian Velard and folk/pop artist Brett Dennen.</p><p>She also toured with Noah Sugarman, another artist on Unison. The label, which is part of a full scale organization that includes a management and production company, was launched by industry veterans Bruce Witkin and Ryan Dorn, who have produced both of Marianne's albums. Unison's eclectic roster also includes British singer/songwriter Stephen Jones, a onetime member of the 90s band Baby Bird whose recordings will be released in the U.K,, and a jazz influenced, New York based singer/songwriter Bobby Syvarth.</p><p>While Beautiful Distraction established Marianne's credentials as a strong, emotionally raw and honest songwriter, Cathartic challenges her generally sunny point of view as she digs deep into the pain and heartache of a life changing, faith shaking relationship. The intense life experience she draws from transforms her from doe-eyed teen into a young adult woman who, emerging from her loss of innocence, truly comes of age as a composer.</p><p>""I went from thinking that people are generally good,"" she says, ""that people have good hearts and come from a good place to realizing that's not necessarily true.  I saw an ugly side of the world.  I don't know if that crisis measures up to some of the ones that others have been through, but I'll never be quite the same. People think the title song is a metaphor about tearing out and burning a page from my diary, but I actually did that. It was a chapter I really wanted to forget. Heartbreak can affect your whole worldview. Where you might once have been carefree, now there's this sense of looking over your shoulder. If younger listeners don't know what the word cathartic means, they will after they listen to that song and the whole album.""</p><p>True to her nature as a creative and career risk taker, Marianne defies some unspoken rules of album making with the new project. The album has 15 songs which, instead of being tracked strategically to mix up, down and mid-tempo songs, combine to tell her story in chronological order, cataloging this time in her life. Listeners are invited experience the entire cycle of emotions through her poetic, intelligent, yet accessible lyrics. Another unique element of Cathartic's development was the fact that the super-prolific songwriter actually wrote close to 100 songs for the project; Witkin and Dorn whittled them down to a final list to choose from by picking the ones whose lyrics would best tell the story.</p><p>""It's hard to pick a single aspect of my career that I love the most,"" Marianne says. ""I really enjoy the recording process, developing a simple idea I started with in my bedroom into a full production. It's also so great to be out there performing, so much so that when I'm home for too long, I get restless. It's cool when people look at me and wonder how I can have such a big voice for such a little girl.

The band features singer-songwriter Scott Kurt, Richard Lewis on bass, and Chris Zogby on drums. Memphis 59's sound, influenced by artists like Tom Petty, Paul Westerberg, Bruce Springsteen, and The Old 97's, is described as a combination of rock, alt-country, and pop. ""Ragged but right"", says Grammy-winning producer John Jennings of Memphis 59's musical style - a description the band liked so much that is was adopted as the title of their first full-length album. Memphis 59 began recording Ragged But Right in the summer of 2009,with the assistance of a trio of Grammy winners lined up to produce, engineer, and play on the record. Released in December of 2009, the album stays true to the band's straight-ahead, guitar driven roots rock sound. Featuring 12 original tracks, Ragged But Right was recorded at the award winning Bias Studios in Springfield, Virginia. Producer John Jennings was named 2008 Producer of the Year by the Washington Area Music Association, and has also worked with Grammy-winning artists Mary Chapin Carpenter, George Jones, Lyle Lovett, and The Indigo Girls. Though relatively new as a band, the individual members of Memphis 59 have years of playing, recording, and performing behind them. Since forming in 2008, Memphis 59 has made a noticeable impact on the Washington, DC music scene by reaching the finals of the Mid-Atlantic Region Band Battle (more than 130 bands entered), and being nominated by the Washington Area Music Association as Best New Band. Recognizing the importance of giving back to fans and to the local community, Memphis 59 donates a portion of the proceeds from every CD sold to the St Jude Children's Research Hospital and frequently plays benefit shows around the Washington, DC metro region.

Galvanized by the local, national and international reaction to her debut, Laura quit her job, packed her bags and toured the country alone to promote the record and launch her career as a performer. After the cycle of touring ended in 2008, Laura began work on her second studio album, Keep Talking. From the cautionary ""Warning Signs"" to the life-affirming ""Get Yourself Right"" to the hyper-personal ""Pilots"", Keep Talking is a rare effort that rocks, soothes and inspired The Washington Post to write, ""When a singer-songwriter builds an array of songs, often arising from a solid pop foundation with a splash of blues, a touch of rock and a hint of soul, that affirms a genuine musical gift.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/lauratsaggaris"" target=""_blank"">Laura Tsaggaris MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",6033,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,5/30/10 23:30VISION the Label brings you: Summer Daze w/ Bliss FM,Philadafuture,DJ M.A.F + DJ Keep Cool,0,JUSTi,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.<br /></em></p><p><strong><br /></strong></p>",5976,$10 advance/ $15 day of show,,5/30/10 3:30EPHEMERAL SUN + 3RDEGREE + BRAVE,,,5665,,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Starting in 1990-New Jersey's 3RDegree-after 2 full-length albums-called it quits in 1997 only to reform in 2005 to create 2008's Narrow-Caster CD which created waves in the progressive rock realm with the Dutch Progressive Rock Page stating ""it's not often an album as refreshing as this comes along, and we should treasure it when it does"" giving it a 9 out of 10 rating in the process.

No surprise, then, that she's learned a thing or two about crafting a great story. Starr regularly pinches a sleight of hand or passing sound bite and turns it into a rich character assessment.</p><p>The Mississippi native struck a major chord on 2002's hallmark Songs From Take-Off to Landing. Breezy tunes like ""Big Sky"", ""At the Heart of This Thing"" and ""Knucklehead"" brought together the independent integrity of Triple-A radio and the polished smile typically aimed at mainstream play. Everything internal-head, heart and hope-worked on a universal scale. The liner notes photo accompanying her acknowledgments spoke volumes: Captured screaming jubilantly, Starr, both hands locked with heavy-metal horns, seems through the clouds. It was a profound high.</p><p>In the years since, Starr has made the road her home and garnered a passionate and loyal following. From her adopted home of Los Angeles to NYC, Nashville to Miami - Starr has crisscrossed the country and continued to entrench herself as a sure fire draw in the indie pop / rock space. Ever the media darling, Starr's focus has never been on their fickle pen, but turned instead to a direct relationship with her fans. Many offer adoration specifically for her consistency, and Starr's genuine, earthy songwriting approach makes it easy to keep rooting-fists clenched and shaking for more artistic evolution. Her songs seem effortless, absolutely unselfconscious and suggest the next time out she might reach the sky again. ""This is really how I feel,"" Starr sings through on ""Spectacle"" from her last release, The Girl That Killed September"", and I'm gonna scream until it's real.""

With a drive to share her music, 365 days has yielded a wealth of creativity, but also recognition, having been chosen to perform at the historic Apollo Theater (tallying a Top 3 Amateur Night performance), opening for Top-40s Matt Nathanson, and scoring a Saturday night gig at NYCs famed The Bitter End, plus more.</p><p>THE MUSIC.</p><p>Danni Rosner writes music all the time- in the car, in the shower- sometimes in the grocery store.

""Over the Top,"" and ""My Piano"" like all of her songs, were written on the keys, but are presented without embellishment- hauntingly stripped and revealing vulnerability.</p><p>The vibe continues with ""Rock on By,"" where Danny Kalb (Beck, Ben Harper, Rilo Kiley, Jack Johnson) and Danni, instead of recording a new studio cut of the song, used a 2 AM demo version recorded in her apartment months prior, because it magically captures the raw emotion of her voice in the most organic kind of way (you can even hear the AC running in the background and her clicking her MACbook to begin the recording.)</p><p>It's clear she knows who she is, and the sophomore indie release, PIANO ACTRESS, sweetly defines the definition.</p><p>ETC.</p><p>The multilingual singer grew up in Tokyo, and returned to the states in high school.

On his upcoming May 11th release, &lsquo;The Chronicle of a Literal Man,' Morsberger takes surreal inspirations and builds a literate rock feast for listeners.

Fortunately for the members of Camera Can't Lie, rock and roll found them.</p><p>Camera is comprised of high school friends Eric Arjes (Vocals/Guitar), Kyle Lindsay (Bass), and hard-hitting drummer Josh Bendell. ""When you live in a small town, there's not always exciting things to do. While our friends were out partying, playing sports, and studying, we were practicing. Everyday."" says Arjes.</p><p>Although, the majority of the band originally comes from classical music backgrounds - symphonies, jazz ensembles, and choirs - their biggest musical inspiration has been 90's radio. ""I wasn't allowed to listen to rock radio when I was growing up, so like all rebellious kids I would come home, sneak into my room and do it anyway,"" laughs Arjes. ""I didn't do it to be disobedient. I did it because there was something in that music that I couldn't find anywhere else.""  The rest of the band holds similar childhood memories whether it be making mix tapes of their favorite songs off the radio or sneaking out of the house to see Blink 182's Dollar Bill Tour.</p><p>The rock group from Minneapolis shares love for more than their musical influences - which range from Third-Eye Blind to the Goo Goo Dolls.  They also love being on the road, a nice round of golf, hanging out with the best fans in the world, spending quality time with their families and friends, and their hometown Minnesota Twins.  Philanthropists through and through, the band recorded and donated an acoustic version of Radiohead's ""High &amp; Dry"" to benefit the Invisible Children organization.  In addition, they were part of the ""Go Green"" tour, sharing a van and backline with other groups to reduce their environmental impact.</p><p>The band signed to Atlantic Records in the spring of 2008 and spent that summer touring and writing for their debut album.  In January 2009 they left the ice-cold-freezer-box they call home and headed to the warmth of Ron Aniello's studio in Los Angeles. Aniello's previous work on bands such as Lifehouse and Guster made him a perfect choice to shape the album that the band envisioned.  ""I spent a lot of time with Ron prior to starting this project and the chemistry between us, both artist to producer and artist to artist, was amazing,"" comments Arjes.  ""I felt inspired and motivated to be a better guitarist, singer and songwriter.  He pushed us further than we've ever gone.""</p><p>Camera tracked almost twenty songs for this record, some of which will be used on a promotional EP, available in October.  ""These songs are an accumulation of the last five years of our lives. I think that's why we are so attached to what we've created and why it's impossible to peg this album with just one theme.  This album is, in so many words, about finding hope in chaos, focusing on the present, speaking with actions instead of words, putting your heart on the line, dealing with internal struggle, and risking the safe and the comfortable for a chance at greatness.  It is a play-by-play of our journey as a band, and I couldn't be more proud."" <br />The outcome?  A five song EP entitled ""Days &amp; Days"" coming out October 2009 and the forthcoming debut full-length album in 2010!</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/cameracantlie"" target=""_blank"">Camera Can't Lie MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Michael Castro is a 22 year old Texas-based singer-musician-songwriter born and raised in Dallas. He entered the music scene on October 3, 2008 when he auditioned for season 8 of American Idol. With literally no musical background and only 20 days of singing experience he advanced through seven audition rounds to the final round of Hollywood week before he was cut. It was both a disappointing and necessary experience. Post American Idol for Castro, (or ""MCas"" as he was dubbed by his fans) consisted of non-stop singing and an ever-growing love for music.</p><p>What started out as a ""self dare"" of sorts turned out to be an all-consuming passion for music and the discovery of a fresh soulful voice drenched with smooth and rough tones. Soon thereafter, he was given his first guitar as a Christmas present. From then on, non-stop singing evolved into non-stop guitar practice and songwriting.   Castro is self taught in both guitar and piano and has discovered a true passion for songwriting.  Within two months of receiving his guitar, he was playing his first show for a private fashion show. One month later he was opening for his brother, Jason Castro, at Texas A&amp;M for thousands of college students.</p><p>For the next few months, Castro took a break from playing shows to focus on song writing, appearing only to perform at the Well Done Awards where he sang with Phil Stacey.</p><p>In early June, with the assist of a genius team of all Grammy Award winners (Prod: Dave Lichens, Mix: Joe Baldridge, Master: Richard Dodd), his debut EP titled ""Michael Castro"" was born.  It consisted of six songs, each with its own distinct anima. He submerged himself in every angle of the project from song writing to production and recording.</p><p>With a can-do attitude and unique writing style he has settled into his own blues-tinged magic. His acoustic soulful style is edgy combined with a raw, organic sound and a hint of grit in his rich voice which is sure to appeal to a broad range of listeners. Michael has a sharp wit that that peeks out between songs and keeps the audience engaged.</p><p>While he used to listen to anything from rap to house music, today Michael is particularly inspired by James Morrison and John Mayer, and says, ""not many people can come close to them.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/michaelcastromusic"" target=""_blank"">Michael Castro MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5783,$15 ,,5/11/10 23:30The Mick Taylor Band (from The Rolling Stones!) - POSTPONED,,,0,,"<p><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>Due to artist illness this show has been postponed.</strong></span></p><p><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>We should know if this can be moved to a later date very soon.

Which isn't surprising, really, since he originally trained to be a chef.</p><p>At age 14, Hoover apprenticed for two years with chefs at a AAA four-diamond restaurant in Connecticut in an effort to build his cooking knowledge base and really learn his way around a kitchen.  He catered parties on the side to earn some money and even considered attending culinary school, but a comment from his sister about learning to play the guitar sparked something inside of him that would decide his future.  Once Andrew picked up his first guitar he was hooked, and he started learning how to play the songs of his musical heroes.  Visions of Michelin stars faded a bit and were put on the back burner, and Hoover sought to learn the instrument inside and out, watching YouTube videos and concert DVD's in an attempt to pick up guitar-playing techniques.</p><p>He started writing songs his senior year in high school, and started singing in college.  ""Around the end of my freshman year,"" Hoover explains, ""it really started to hit me that this was something I wanted to do.  I wanted to write songs and be a musician and make a living at it.""  By the time his sophomore year in college rolled around, he was spending all of his free time in the music practice rooms when he wasn't doing homework.  At the end of that year, with his parents' blessing, he quit school to follow his dream of making music full time.</p><p>He recorded his first EP in his garage, and self-released it in 2007.  Andrew mapped out and booked his own tour, which took him from Maine down to Florida and west to Chicago, hitting all of the points in between. ""I just wanted to play,"" Hoover remembers.  ""Anywhere I could find an audience, I was there. It was not just what I had to do to build a name for myself, but it was also what I wanted to do.""  A second solo acoustic EP soon followed to stoke his growing fan base.</p><p>Andrew caught the attention of Rock Ridge Music through the new ""old fashioned way"" of MySpace outreach, sending messages to fans of comparable artists.  Rock Ridge staffer Carly Kent received one of Andrew's messages, and liked what she heard enough to catch a show in New York.  Blown away by what she saw, Kent passed along Andrew's demo to label President Jason Spiewak.  Skeptical as always, Spiewak listened and was impressed.  It was one of Hoover's YouTube videos that cemented Spiewak's interest.  ""Andrew Hoover is a show-stopping entertainer.  He draws people in with his percussive, unique style of guitar playing and makes them fall in love with his unbelievable voice.""</p><p>Hoover signed with Rock Ridge Music in 2008, and hit the studio with Spiewak in New York City to record his full-length debut.  In addition to the NYC sessions, Andrew traveled South to work with Chris Henderson of 3 Doors Down fame at his Rivergate Studios in Hendersonville, Tennessee.  The result is Hoover's full-band debut album, ""Chances, Stances &amp; Romances,"" which will be released on September 22, 2009.</p><p>Andrew is a solo musician, though he voices several instruments in his live shows.  His unique slap guitar style carries inspirations from the bass and percussion instruments, giving his songs a groove and rhythm not often associated with singer-songwriters.  His vocal style is raw and original, colorful, and dynamic.  Andrew takes his cues from a variety of his heroes including but not limited to Stevie Wonder, Otis Redding, Marc Broussard, Ray LaMontagne, Raul Midon, James Morrison, and Martin Sexton.</p><p>Andrew kicked off 2010 by performing on Sixthman's The Rock Boat sharing the stage with artists such as Marc Broussard, Will Hoge, Stephen Kellogg &amp; The Sixers, Tyrone Wells, and Augustana. Throughout 2010 he will continue to tour to promote 'Chances, Stances &amp; Romances'  and build on a touring history that already includes previous performances in support of Sister Hazel, Elliott Yamin, Tim Reynolds, Dave Barnes, Ernie Halter, Ari Hest, the Alternate Routes, and Kate Voegele.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/andrewhoovermusic"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Hoover MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/ianaxel"" target=""_blank"">Ian Axel MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",5843,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,5/10/10 0:00Just Surrender,Comic Book Heroes,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Comic Book Heroes &reg; are four high school seniors based in Wyomissing, PA.

The Tao Seeger Band includes Tao singing lead vocals, playing electric guitar and banjo, Laura Cortese on fiddle and vocals, Jake Silver on bass, Jason Crosby on keyboards and Robin MacMillan on drums. Their music can be described as a fusion of rock and folk with a ""rootsy and psychedelic"" sound. The newly formed band has performed at an impressive lineup of events including the 2009 New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, Newport Folk Festival, Monterey Jazz Festival and The Clearwater Concert: Creating the Next Generation of Environmental Leaders at Madison Square Garden where they stood in as the evening's house band. Together they have also toured throughout the northeast and Denmark and recently hit the road for an east coast tour in late 2009. Their debut album Rise and Bloom is currently wrapping up in the studio and is expecting a 2010 release.</p><p>2009 was a monumental year in Tao's musical career filled with extraordinary experiences. In January he performed at the Presidential Inauguration for Barack Obama alongside Bruce Springsteen and Pete in front of over 1.5 million people. An exciting day but the chilling temperature proved to be too much for his guitar, which cracked during their inaugural performance. However, Tao will always consider it his lucky guitar because the President Elect took the time to sign it, ""This Land Is Your Land - Barack Obama."" His May performance at Madison Square Garden was filmed for the PBS series Great Performances and made into a 2-DVD set chronicling the historic night. Tao was approached by Sesame Street to write and record two original songs for Plaza Sesamo, the Spanish edition of Sesame Street, and star in their music videos. In 2007 Tao was featured in the Emmy winning documentary film, Pete Seeger - The Power of Song, where he performed at Carnegie Hall with Arlo Guthrie in his annual Thanksgiving concert.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/taorodriguezseeger"" target=""_blank"">Tao Seeger Band MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",5690,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,4/17/10 23:00Jammin' 4 Haiti,,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be seated.</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5365,$8 ,,4/16/10 22:00Jason Reeves + Chelsea Lee,,,5361,,"<p><strong>EARLY SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be seated.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/chelsealeemusic"" target=""_blank"">Chelsea Lee MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5362,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,4/16/10 1:00Private Event,,,0,,,5360,,,4/14/10 0:00"Neil Innes (Monty Python, Rutles)",,,0,,<p><em>This show will be seated.</em></p>,5359,$15 ,,4/13/10 0:00DC101's Last Band Standing,,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5357,$10 ,,4/11/10 21:15Shannon McNally and Hot Sauce,Birdie Busch,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be seated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Birdie Busch's atmospheric folk, which often aches with strains of country-blues, jumps out with a rockabilly swagger and blushes with whimsical pretty-girl-telling-you-a-secret lilt that's all her own, and doesn't really fit any category or genre. And what is it? Sharp, sweet acoustic music that's too loud for a living room and too smart for the charts. It's weird and winding: she sings about magic, luck, the universe, the human heart speeding off on dangerous missions like Inspector Gadget. An intimate partnership with long time bandmates has assured that her records are cohesive and remarkably mature, a dreamy Americana too warm to be made in this decade but too grounded and aware to be made anytime else.<br /> <br />Coming out of what could be called a veritable roots-rock renaissance that has put Philadelphia back at the top of the list of America's music capitals, she joins other talented locals and partners in crime in creating a tight-knit community that seeks to make great music, inspire people and see what happens.<br /> <br />Critics from the Village Voice to American Songwriter have admiringly found her of kindred spirit to everyone from Syd Barrett to Eudora Welty and All Music Guide exclaimed that she is one of the ""most affecting altos around"".<br /> <br />Pattern of Saturn, Birdie's newest release, was recorded over the span of the past year. Recorded in various Philly friends' converted spaces from basements to bedrooms and even hijacking the local high school's choir room for some piano additions, the result is both rootsy and inventive, bold yet intimate.  Percussion goes from light-hearted carriage clip-clops to the chains of the ghost of Christmas past and guitars, both electric and acoustic, cover ground between country, classical, psychedelic, and blues without falling into the position of bland redux.<br /> <br />Subject matter ranges from Birdie taking on the voice of a Mexican dishwasher named Gabino to dealing with the modern problems of Internet password pile-up. The album title is taken from an instrumental piece that rests in the center of the recording and she included other instrumental pieces as well.  It's a broad spectrum but Birdie has always believed in our multitudes and found inspiration in gray areas and mulit-faceted emotions. The trick is how she seems to encapsulate it, as we find in writers like Neil Young and Paul Simon, in what feels like very buoyant and effortless attempts.<br /> <br />Put out on her own imprint Monotask Music, its her continuing effort to make music that always wanders in wonder but never wanders from her hopes to keep creating music that is of her voice. It's music that grows with repeated listens and shows you different things in different moments, with words that can strike too close to home and melodies that never wear out.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/birdiebusch"" target=""_blank"">Birdie Busch MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5526,$12 ,,4/8/10 23:30I Saw A Ghost + The Kindness Of Strangers,A Sense Of Urgency,Failing The Fallen + Thatswhatshesaid,5514,Light Up The Sky,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thatswhatshesaid45111"" target=""_blank"">Thatswhatshesaid MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/ftfhxc"" target=""_blank"">Failing The Fallen MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/lightuptheskyva"" target=""_blank"">Light Up The Sky MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/asouva"" target=""_blank"">A Sense Of Urgency MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thekindnessofstrangersrock"" target=""_blank"">The Kindness Of Strangers MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",5515,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,4/8/10 0:00Shane Hines (acoustic),Scott Simons,,0,Bleu,"<p><em>This show will be seated.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/bleutopia"" target=""_blank"">Bleu MySpace</a><em><br /></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/scottsimonsmusic"" target=""_blank"">Scott Simons MySpace</a><em><br /></em></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5349,$12 ,,4/7/10 0:00The Spring Standards + Via Audio + Paper Bird,,,5347,,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paper Bird's backbone is their songwriting, musicianship and a general allergy to all limitations and trends.

In the process - with help from the driving beat of drummer Brad Horner - Moreland &amp; Arbuckle have forged a relentless and haunting sound that merges Delta blues, folk, rock, traditional country, soul and numerous other echoes and murmurs from an infinitely layered musical narrative that spans more than a century.</p><p>The Moreland &amp; Arbuckle journey began when the two met at an open-mic jam at a club in Wichita, Kansas, in 2001. Moreland had just moved into town a few months earlier from Emporia - a city located some eighty-five miles to the northeast. A guitarist since age 15, his source material was admittedly diverse - Led Zeppelin, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Black Sabbath, Charley Patton, Motley Crue - but he'd settled into traditional blues by the time he'd arrived in Wichita in his mid-20s.</p><p>Arbuckle, a native of Wichita, had been playing in a blues rock bar band at the time, but his truest sensibilities ran a couple generations deeper, into the heart of the Mississippi Delta. He counts iconic figures like harpists Little Walter and Sonny Boy Williams and guitarist Son House among his most profound influences.</p><p>""It was kind of perfect,"" says Arbuckle of the chance encounter between the two musicians. ""We had a shared vision, in a place where there really wasn't much interest in - or support for - country blues.""</p><p>Moreland joined Arbuckle's blues rock band for the last few months before the project dissolved, then the two started a quartet called the Kingsnakes, which Arbuckle describes as ""electrified Mississippi blues mixed with a sludgy, jam-oriented rock thing."" The project incorporated a range of sounds: soul, country, funk, jam rock, blues and whatever else worked. Horner joined in 2003, but left after just a few months. A few bass players came and went in the years that followed, until Moreland and Arbuckle discovered they could lay down a solid groove on their own - with the help of Horner, who had returned by the fall of 2006.</p><p>Then again, Moreland does his share of work at the bottom end. In addition to the more typical Telecaster and Les Paul guitars, his arsenal also includes a hand-crafted instrument consisting of four strings stretched across a cigar box. One string feeds into a bass amp, and the other three into a guitar amp. It's a gritty, electrified descendent of the cigar box guitars played by countless Delta bluesmen of the early 1900s who, for all of their innate talents, were too impoverished to afford the real thing.</p><p>""There was no real adjustment for me,"" Moreland says of his first encounter with the instrument, which was crafted by a friend in Memphis. ""I just picked it up and played it. When I play a regular guitar, I hold down those bottom strings with my thumb and pluck those to get a kind of groove going. So when I first started playing the cigar box with the bass string, it just worked perfect with my style of playing.""</p><p>Moreland &amp; Arbuckle crafted three self-produced album in rapid-fire succession - Caney Valley Blues in 2005, Floyd's Market in 2006 and 1861 in 2008. ""There have been times in the past when I've gone on a rant that we're not writing enough,"" says Moreland. ""But then I look at our catalog and say, &lsquo;Well, that's stupid. We've put out all this stuff in a short period of time.' When I look at it that way, I'd say we're fairly prolific.""</p><p>The band took that hefty catalog to Iraq for nearly two weeks in the fall of 2008 to play for the American troops stationed there. ""It was a crazy awesome experience,"" says Moreland. ""Super-grueling. Twelve days of about four hours of sleep per day. From a physical standpoint, it was pretty tough. But to go into a tattered, war-torn area where tens of thousands of fellow Americans were putting their lives on the line every day, minute by minute, was a very rewarding experience. I'd never experienced anything like it before.""</p><p>Moreland &amp; Arbuckle make their debut on Telarc International, a division of Concord Music Group, with the February 2010 release of Flood. The album is the latest step in the trio's never-ending quest to unearth the rawest and most honest elements of the American music tradition - without getting caught up in definitions and categories that would only serve to limit the vision.</p><p>""It's hard to say exactly what we are and what we do,"" says Arbuckle. ""Blues is definitely at the core, but we're huge fans of all sorts of American music, and all of that comes through as well. Obviously, there are elements of traditional country in what we do, elements of vintage rock and roll, soul and all that sort of stuff. We always try to stay grounded in that traditional blues center, and at the same time branch out and do as many different things as we can while still keeping it consistent with the sound we've developed.""</p><p>Nearly a decade into the journey, Flood represents a turning point in the Moreland &amp; Arbuckle story - a new layer of excavation at that point in the road where powerful forces meet and new secrets are discovered. ""The record is very spooky,"" says Arbuckle. ""We've never made a record before that has the earthy, spooky vibe that this one has. It creates an atmosphere that's ripe for storytelling. There's something about this music that makes you want to settle in and listen.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/morelandandarbuckle"" target=""_blank"">Moreland &amp; Arbuckle MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5342,$15 ,,4/2/10 0:00Bill Kirchen & Too Much Fun w/ Special Guest Austin de Lone - Spring Thaw Extravaganza,,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be seated.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/austindelone"" target=""_blank"">Austin de Lone MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5443,$20 ,,4/1/10 0:30Benjy Davis Project CD Release,Matt Duke,,0,Seth Glier,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/sethglier"" target=""_blank"">Seth Glier MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/mattduke"" target=""_blank"">Matt Duke MySpace</a><em><br /></em></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",5339,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,3/30/10 23:30An Evening with Pierre Bensusan - CANCELLED,,,0,,"<p><span style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>This show has been cancelled.

The evening will feature 45 minutes by the percussive guitarist, soul singer and founder of recording industry resource SplashKit.com. Scheduled guests include Jeff Severson, Justin Poroszok, Jim Baughman, and others.</p><p>Townsend's passion for music began at the age of five. A Mickey Mouse record player became his first muse. ""You couldn't separate me from that thing. I spun the purple records almost exclusively, using Beatles 45s as frisbees."" Purple labels were a staple of Motown, and heavy doses of Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross and Donna Summer meant his soul would never rest.</p><p>9Davine presents a catalog of music that's rich in mood and visuals.

Annika and Emily hosted an informal session to meet new musicians. Among them was Mike, who stayed with the two with the goal of creating music with a fusion of innovation and traditional musical theory.</p><p>Since then, Power Pirate has found its place in the DC/MD/VA music scene through catchy melodies and complex instrumentation. Inspired by modern artists such as Muse, Infected Mushroom, and Daft Punk, this trio fuses 80s-styled techno synths with hard-rock drum beats and guitar riffs to create the new, uncategorized genre unique to Power Pirate.</p><p><a href=""http://power-pirate.com/"" target=""_blank"">Power Pirate Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>DeVille fuses pop hooks and soulful vocals with driving, energetic rock'n'roll -- as perfect for fist-pumping rockers as it is for someone who just wants to get on the dance floor and move.</p><p>The name ""DeVille"" has a few meanings.

Additionally, the Dewdrops were selected as finalists in the 2009 Mountain Stage NewSong competition.

For more than seven years, the group has worked hard to find their groove, combining everyone's creativity and inspiration into MadBrenda's musical creations. Tom provides mindblowing riffs while Matt thickens our sound with the aid of his own guitar. Sam sings her heart out and proudly struts her bass. Torie, the drummer, has proudly been called a human metronome.</p><p>MadBrenda is not only a band, but also a family. We were established by our dedication to creating music, and by our love and care for one another. It's through our commitment to each other and to everyone involved that the band has flourished.</p><p>We play everything from the White Stripes, Blink-182, AC/DC, U2, and Goldfinger to our very own musical makings, including ""Pity,"" ""Cancer Stick,"" and ""Psychcotic Reaction."" Each band member has written an original, which serves to make our own songs distinct and different from other bands you've heard.</p><p>We may not be the ""typical"" definition of a rock band, but we certainly take pride in the fact that we are unique.

Rather then shy away from the competition, however, ETA relished the challenge, the local music scene emboldening them to create bigger and better tracks. Sweet pop influences filter through their distinctive rock undertones, pulling you in and gripping you tightly until the very last notes have finished ringing in your eardrums. The vocals provide stark contrast to Rayshawn's pulse-pounding rhymes, resulting in a thrill-ride from beginning to end that you just can't seem to get out of your head.</p><p>ETA's efforts came to fruition. They worked hard and played even harder. The recent addition of a new vocalist, Chris, brings lyrical and musical experience into an already diverse and accomplished group. The result? You don't have to strain very hard to hear it. ETA travels around the Northern VA/MD area, playing shows in a wide variety of venues. And they leave their mark wherever they go; whipping each crowd into a frenzy and threatening to blow the roofs skyward.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/escapethearmada"" target=""_blank"">Escape the Armada MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",0,$10 ,,1/3/10 23:00An Evening with Andre Hehanussa,,,0,,<p><em>This show will be seated.</em></p>,4519,$30 ,,1/3/10 18:00Luke Mitchem,Laura Brino,,0,Katherine Thorsey,"<p><em>This show will be seated.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/katherinethorsey"" target=""_blank"">Katherine Thorsey MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/laurabrino"" target=""_blank"">Laura Brino MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",4179,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,1/3/10 3:00Autism Awareness Matinee,The Kindness Of Strangers,Public Saxophone,0,Youth In Asia,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://myspace.com/publicsaxophone"" target=""_blank"">Public Saxophone Myspace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://myspace.com/youthinasiava"" target=""_blank"">Youth In Asia Myspace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://myspace.com/thekindnessofstrangersrock"" target=""_blank"">The Kindness Of Strangers Myspace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",3950,$8 ,,1/2/10 23:30We Like to Party feat.

Like is putting the final touches on his latest mixtape set for a release on Valentines Day. Despite his age, M.A.F. has been able to buff his resume with gigs and musical releases that most DJs only dream of. M.A.F. has played sold out shows in not only the DC metropolitan area but also overseas at some of London's most prestigious clubs. ""My time in London taught me how to rock a party, and not just with hip-hop because most clubs there don't really cater to hip-hop audience."" Although an admitted hip-hop fanatic, M.A.F. is not afraid to cross genre boundaries as exemplified in his past two solo release, Party in a Box and more notably, This is Hipster-Hop. ""The response was crazy, unexpected to say the least. I was just having fun but people really seemed to like the whole Hip-House thing I was experimenting with."" His newest project, Ladies Love M.A.F., follows suit, with neck snapping drum tracks, teeth rattling bass lines and samples from some of today's hottest club hits it's more music than mash-ups. So what's next for a young DJ with an insatiable appetite for music and the industry, ""I've actually got a communications class in like an hour so we're going to have to cut this short.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/mafthedj"" target=""_blank"">DJ M.A.F.

Anderson and Depew started playing music together in junior high, when they rigged up a drum kit out of cardboard boxes, Legos and G.I. Joe parts. Upon meeting Ginsberg in high school, they immediately clicked as a trio but took separate paths after graduation. In time, Anderson - who had moved to North Carolina and was working as an artist at a video game company - began writing songs over the phone with Ginsberg, who was studying jazz at USC in Los Angeles. Collaborating became easier after Activision offered Anderson a job in L.A. and relocated him. The two recorded an EP in Anderson's office after hours and soon Depew joined them in L.A.</p><p>After a few self-booked tours, they stuck their stuff in storage and hit the road for the long haul. Their gigs earned them just enough to fill the RV's gas tank, so the band lived off food from fans. ""We'd post it on our MySpace page - 'hey, if you want to bring non-perishables or water to the show, we'll hook you up with some free merch,'"" remembers Ginsberg.</p><p>By the time Single File signed to Reprise Records, the band had three EP's, two consecutive years on the Vans Warped tour and a local radio hit to its credit. ""Zombies Ate My Neighbors"" made it to No. 1 on KTCL, the Clear Channel alternative radio station in Denver - after the program director at local hard rock station KBPI discovered it in a station contest and sent it on to a colleague at KTCL. (A newly recorded version of the song appears on Common Struggles .) Grateful for the early support, the band will release ""Girlfriends,"" its upcoming single, to Denver radio in March, with Reprise Records servicing it to the rest of the country a month later.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/singlefile"" target=""_blank"">Single File MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/mercymercedes"" target=""_blank"">Mercy Mercedes MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",0,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,11/22/09 23:00Push Play + Emily Osment,Phil Bensen,,4217,,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/philbensen"" target=""_blank"">Phil Bensen MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After seeing Emily Osment for years on TV and film, most notably as Lilly Truscott in the phenomenally successful ""Hannah Montana"" franchise, fans will now get their first chance to truly hear her.</p><p>On ""All the Right Wrongs,"" Osment arrives as a fully formed singer/songwriter so accomplished that it's hard to believe she is only 17. From sounds that get you up on your feet to wrenching ballads, her songs are anchored by her keen, observational lyrics; instantly memorable melodies and Osment's wonderfully expressive vocals.</p><p>""It's my first album so I want so much out of it. I want to cram everything I've been doing for the past 17 years into it,"" Osment says.</p><p>Influenced by her parents, both of whom are musically inclined, and her brother, Oscar nominee Haley Joel Osment, Osment grew up in a household surrounded by music-much of it classic rock and roll. ""My brother got his first electric guitar when he was 13 and the house was never quiet again,"" she laughs. Osment, who also plays guitar, recalls writing her first song when she was three. It was about a tree. The first album she ever bought was either the Monkees' greatest hits or The Beatles' Abbey Road. (She can't remember). Now, her tastes run more toward Animal Collective, Led Zeppelin, REM, the Pixies, Portishead and fellow emotional truth teller, Alanis Morissette. ""I went through a big Alanis period,"" she says. Like Morissette, Osment wants to strip away any distance between her and the listener. ""She was an inspiration for a lot of the songs I wrote with Max and Tony.""</p><p>Now, she's eager for others to hear her songs and is thankful she funneled her passion into this musical expression. ""I wanted to put that energy to good use. Making this record has been so much fun and has allowed me to be the most creative I have ever been in my life.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/emilyosment"" target=""_blank"">Emily Osment MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",4218,$12 advance/ $15 day of show,,11/22/09 2:00Tracy Grammer + Pierce Pettis,,,3712,,"<p>Pierce Pettis, adored by both critics and public alike, is one of this generation's most masterful songwriters.

Although making noises and sounds with his mouth since the age of ten, Heatbox hit the scene with Twin Cities-based funk, rock and blues group Root City Band.  The group won several awards (including ""Best Blues Band of the Twin Cities"" in 2006) and Heatbox picked up a few of his own (1st place at the 2007 ""Yo The Music"" Minneapolis Beatbox Battle) before the two artists parted ways.</p><p>Since then Heatbox has been writing new material, expanding his catalog of choice covers and performing to crowds throughout the country.  Asked what it's like to perform and tour as a solo act, Heatbox says ""I get to avoid so many of the negative things that happen in bands. Things like fighting, or drug abuse, or money problems and such. I never have to do anything other than exactly what I want to do in my art. I also have very little gear to carry around. On the other hand...there is nothing like the feeling of really rockin' out with your good friends.

Her first two albums, Boundary County (self-released, 2006) and Letters from Sinners and Strangers (Signature Sounds, 2007) were astonishingly assured efforts, which matched Jewell's understated yet insightful songs with a rugged blend of Americana styles. They were met with a great deal of acclaim, with No Depression raving that ""Jewell is showing she can wander with the best of them, and write riveting song-stories about her adventures along the way."" Indicative of Jewell's strong following in Europe, The Word in the UK described her as ""A voice of real distinction [that] manages to transcend some powerful influences and pierce the fog long enough for her own point of view to emerge.""</p><p>""On those albums,"" she reflects, ""people told me they heard folk, country, western swing, rockabilly, and even jazz...but a part of my roots has been left out up until now.""</p><p>On April 21, Signature Sounds will release Eilen Jewell's third album, Sea of Tears, a recording that fills in a vital, hitherto missing element of her musical persona.

Antje chose one of her favorite songwriters, Richard Shindell to produce the album. Richard lent his talent to the record and brought in well respected musicians such as John Gorka, Lucy Kaplansky and Victor Krauss.</p><p>""What a blessing to have worked with someone as talented as Antje.

The album revolves around relationships and the emotions that feed and sap them, of those who want out, those who want in, and those who are torn between leaving and staying. Conflict between lovers is the set's thematic crux, the ""Great Divide"" that Mike Mangione is forever attempting to bestride, the details of which are mostly sketchy, but the repercussions and emotions they evoke as sharp as glass. And it's those emotions that wash strongest over the set, although the lyrics linger. Like all good poetry, one's meant to luxuriate in the beauty of their structure, the lovely twist of the words, and the hidden meanings occasionally found within. The music provides plenty of scope to immerse oneself in the vocals; it's a sublime backdrop that provides support for, but never overshadows, the lyrics. The warmth of the sound, the shadowed melodies, the rhythms that add urgency to the words, and the depths of mood the strings subtly add, all feed the pensive air of the set. A sublime album to be enjoyed at leisure, a late night pleasure or rainy afternoon delight."" <em>-Jo-Ann Greene, All Music Guide </em></p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/mikemangione"" target=""_blank"">Mike Mangione MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",3926,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,10/31/09 21:30Rock 'n Roll Songwriters Circle,,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be seated.</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><p>Featuring Luke Brindley, Anthony Fiacco, Shane Hines, and Todd Wright.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",3924,$10 advance/ $12 day of show,,10/31/09 2:00Cerca Trova + The Automatics,Box Robots,Solace Sovay,4010,Hero Of The Beach,"<p><strong>EARLY SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/solacesovay"" target=""_blank"">Solace Sovay MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/heroofthebeach"" target=""_blank"">Hero of the Beach MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/boxrobots"" target=""_blank"">Box Robots MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",4011,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,10/30/09 23:00The Downtown Fiction,Cash Cash,,0,Amely,"<p><strong>LATE SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/amely"" target=""_blank"">Amely MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/cashcash"" target=""_blank"">Cash Cash MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",0,$12 ,,10/30/09 1:00The Downtown Fiction,Cash Cash,,0,Amely,"<p><strong>EARLY SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/amely"" target=""_blank"">Amely MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/cashcash"" target=""_blank"">Cash Cash MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",0,$12 ,,10/28/09 0:30Joshua James,Keegan DeWitt,,0,Chris Ayer,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chris Ayer is a Brooklyn, NY-based singer-songwriter.

A four-piece alternative rock band hailing from Washington, DC, Honeychuck is full of a contagious energy every time they hit the stage, and they're blowing away audiences one venue at a time. The talent, experience, and sheer determination of all four members create a sound and personality bred from honest songwriting and captivating performances. Since their creation in 2002, Honeychuck has evolved into a dynamic alternative rock band, tapping into their roots (from blues to metal, from folk to grunge) and impressing everyone along the way.</p><p>With their album ""It's Not You, It's Me,"" Honeychuck has made a statement from coast to coast; the band spent two weeks on a tour of the Southwest, stomping their way into the southern California and Arizona music scenes. Mixed by Brooklyn, NY's Tim Donovan (Lisa Loeb, Erykah Badu, 310), the four soaring tracks leave listeners both satisfied and wanting more. ""It's Not You, It's Me"" captures the essence of the band's sound, highlighting Debra Guy's aggressive yet pure voice, the tastefully blazing guitar work of T.Wesley, combined with the rock-solid rhythm section of Ben Pettit and Sam Murray.</p><p>Boasting over a decade of combined musical experience, the members of Honeychuck have received some long overdue credit, recently playing Washington DC's 9:30 Club, as well as headlining Falls Church, Virginia's State Theatre with their electric and gratifying live show. 2010 will ring in Honeychuck's follow-up record, raising the bar even higher and picking up right where they left off. The band's on-stage and musical chemistry is evident in every show they play, and every new song they write. Honeychuck provides clarity, reminding listeners of everything the love about music, tapping into familiarities and pushing the envelope all at the same time.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/honeychuck"" target=""_blank"">Honeychuck MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",3917,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,10/23/09 0:00Private Event,,,0,,,3914,,,10/21/09 0:00Justin Trawick,Idea Track,,0,Christina Courtin,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/christinacourtin"" target=""_blank"">Christina Courtin MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/ideatrackmusic"" target=""_blank"">Idea Track MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",3915,$10 advance/ $13 day of show,,10/20/09 0:00Chris Pureka,Peasant,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be seated.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/peasant"" target=""_blank"">Peasant MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",3419,$10 advance/ $13 at the door,,10/18/09 23:30Erin McKeown + Jill Sobule,,,3171,,"<p><em>This show will be seated.</em></p><p><br />Jill Sobule belongs to a rare breed of artists. Her work is at once deeply personal and socially conscious, seriously funny and derisively tragic. Over five albums and a decade of recording, the Denver-born songwriter/guitarist/singer has tackled such topics as the death penalty, anorexia, shoplifting, reproduction, the French resistance movement, adolescence, and the Christian right. Did we mention love? Love found, love lost, love wished for and love taken away.</p><p>While her songs cover a huge amount of ground, they all have benefit greatly from Jill's subtle intelligence and skillful light-handedness. No sloganeering flag-and-fist waving here, but rather story songs about human beings, real and imagined, which allow us to step back from the issue, be it personal or social, and relate to it as we would a close friend.</p><p>To see Jill live and in concert is a rare treat. It is on stage that she is most comfortable, most powerful, and where the delicacy and range of her work can be best appreciated. She entertains, amuses, provokes, and more often then not, takes her audiences on an emotional roller coaster, from comedy to pathos in a few bars of music.</p><p><a href=""http://www.jillsobule.com"" target=""_blank"">Jill Sobule Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",3172,$15 advance/ $18 at the door,,10/18/09 18:00The Influence + The B-Film Extras,Family of the Year,,3779,Sydney Wayser,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/sydneywayser"" target=""_blank"">Sydney Wayser MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/familyoftheyear"" target=""_blank"">Family of the Year MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thebfilmextras"" target=""_blank"">The B-Film Extras MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",3780,$10 ,,10/18/09 0:00The Alexandria Kleztet & Susan Gaeta,special guest Jon Carroll,,2862,,"<p><a href=""http://www.joncarroll.org"" target=""_blank"">Jon Carroll Website</a></p><p><br />Vocalist/guitarist Susan Gaeta is an important member of a new generation of musicians who are exploring the rich and varied traditions of Sephardic music.

His guitar solos would amaze and his songwriting would captivate. It would take the world years to catch up. Indeed, they're still doing so.</p><p>Ironically, Will probably would have made it by now if TOO MANY talents didn't shackle him. His guitar playing has made him a sought-after sideman, playing for Jimmy Buffett (who recorded Will's ""Piece of Work"" on his License to Chill CD), Rodney Crowell, Todd Snider, Kim Richey, Josh Rouse and many, many others both in the studio and onstage. Will's prowess on the six-string has led to a fan-produced T-shirt that says ""Will Kimbrough is an alien."" It seems to be the only way to explain his mastery. For most folks, that would be enough. And if that were all he had to concentrate on, he'd be well known by now.</p><p>But he also produces, including a Grammy-nominated record by Adrienne Young, well-received records by Kate Campbell, and his co-production work on Todd Snider's acclaimed ""East Nashville Skyline"". Indeed, if he concentrated on production alone, perhaps he'd be better known.</p><p>But then there is Will Kimbrough the solo artist. His solo records, ""This"", ""Home Away"", ""Godsend"" and his upcoming, yet to be titled release betray an immense command of songwriting craft - catchy hooks, haunting, introspective lyrics, and a tasteful resistance to making his own records a showcase merely for his guitar prowess. Once again, if that were all he did, people would know him now.</p><p><a href=""http://www.willkimbrough.com/"" target=""_blank"">Will Kimbrough Website</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",3186,$15 advance/ $18 at the door,,9/30/09 23:30Charlotte Martin,Matt Duke,,0,,"<p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/mattduke"" target=""_blank"">Matt Duke MySpace</a></p>",3113,$15 ,,9/29/09 23:30Tyrone Wells (plugged in and rockin!),The Myriad,,0,Matt Hires,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p><strong>Tyrone Wells - One man brings two very different nights to Jammin Java:</strong></p><p>Tuesday, September 29th - Tyrone Wells and the band will strip away all the amps and drums and bring you an intimate acoustic show that feels like the old days when Tyrone got his start in a small coffee shop in California.

Her CD ""Wanted You to Know"" takes the listener on their own personal journey through songs like ""Wanted You To Know"", and ""Bottles and Bruises""  as well as leaving them feeling empowered with songs like ""Back There"" and ""On My Way"".   Blair's overall talents have received positive press reviews; an invitation to sing the National Anthem for the Washington Nationals, and multiple placements on published compilation CD's to name a few.

Instead of falling into the scenes around them, the group wove together threads of pop-punk, synth rock and tight harmonies into a unique power-pop sound, a melodic blast that owes as much to the Beach Boys as it does to Green Day. As they began to tour throughout the East, attracting new fans in every city they played, the band's undeniable hooks began to attract label attention, including that of Epitaph owner Brett Gurewitz.

If that's true up-and-coming Phoenix, AZ pop-rock band Anarbor will likely see great heights. Guitarist Mike Kitlas and singer/bassist Slade Echeverria have been friends since kindergarten, giving the band a foundation beyond just making music and playing shows. Mike and Slade met Greg in middle school and spontaneously decided it would be fun to form a band. Guitarist Adam Juwig, whom they met through a friend, and was added to the mix shortly thereafter. ""From that moment on we were like &lsquo;Okay you play the drums, you play the guitar, you sing,'"" Mike explains. ""We just picked our roles and then two months later we all had our instruments and we were jamming.""</p><p>Although Slade says it ""took a while"" for the group to get good at their instruments, Anarbor was solidified in a real band with big plans. Once high school rolled around, the band found a balance between music and their devotion to completing their education, sometimes skipping school to play shows around the West Coast with bands like My American Heart, The Rocket Summer and The Higher and trekking to Austin for the South by South West Music Festival. ""We would unfortunately have to sacrifice some time at school to get to those events, but in the end it was worth it,"" Mike says. ""It's amazing some of us made it through school.

After leaving the popular and now defunct band Welbilt in late 2007, he laid low for the following year planning for his reemergence to the local music scene with songs more the singer/songwriter vein.  His debut solo performance was in early 2009 at DC 101's Local Lix Live, one of the area's rock radio station's local music shows.  He played to a sold out crowd and from that point it was clear that he had reinvented himself.  He was ready to move forward with his new solo project.</p><p>In early May of this year Ihara was asked by the owner of one of the area's most esteemed clubs, Jammin' Java, to open for the Texas based band Fastball.  The show earned him new fans and attention from other local artists and venues.</p><p>""It's been a slow and arduous process starting over from scratch,"" he stated.  ""The Washington Area music scene is still alive and well, maybe more than ever and the people in it are all about helping each other out.""</p><p>Ihara has spent this past spring in the studio with area songwriter and producer Todd Wright.  He has been recording with various supporting artists including members of The Pat McGee Band, No Second Troy, and The Blackjacks.  His debut EP is scheduled for release in late August of this year.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/nateiharamusic"" target=""_blank"">Nate Ihara MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",2966,"$12, or just $20 for BOTH shows!",,7/21/09 23:00Betaraz DMV Showcase Vol. 6,,,0,,<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p>,3202,$12 ,,7/21/09 0:00The Waybacks + Devon Sproule,Carsie Blanton,,3176,,"<p><em>This show will be seated.</em></p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/carsieblanton"" target=""_blank"">Carsie Blanton MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>""I asked God for a good job.

Perhaps a hint of homesickness is understandable.  Not only did Ms. Sproule spend much of the last two years touring abroad, her new album -- produced by husband Paul Curreri and featuring the pedal steel playing of the legendary BJ Cole -- was recorded, for the most part, in England.</p><p>""Last year was a good one,"" Sproule says, ""and full of adventures.  I drove myself all the way from Scotland on the left side of the road for a radio show.  I learned the intro to ""Johnny B. Goode"" before 8am in a Spanish hotel.  I even smoked a J with Lucinda Williams and kept my cool.""</p><p>""Musically,"" she continues, ""after a whole summer of festivals in the UK, my band was feeling great.  Everything was.  It wasn't even raining that much!  It would've been a shame not to capture something from that time, to let that phase of our playing evaporate into the next.  So we booked this studio out in the country.""</p><p>Continuing in the tradition of her previous works, &iexcl;Don't Hurry for Heaven! sports a variety of sonic influences: the title track -- a tipsy, twangy, spousal nudge -- wears a cowboy boot on one foot, and another on its head.  The great Jesse Winchester, a fellow Southerner (and hero of Sproule's), makes a cameo on the uber-groovy ""Ain't That the Way.""  Sproule and Curreri even duet on a left-field, desert-bluesy version of Black Uhuru's ""Sponji Reggae.""</p><p>Devon Sproule's last record, 2007's Keep Your Silver Shined proved an indie hit in the US, UK, Ireland and Europe.  Sproule toured with Woodstock legend Richie Havens, Lambchop frontman Kurt Wagner, and supported back-to-back nights in London with Lucinda Williams.</p><p>""These songs are beautiful, timeless and transporting."" <em>-Davy Rothbart of This American Life</em></p><p>""Vintage country...with jazzy sophistication..."" <em>-BBC</em></p><p><em></em></p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/devonsproule"" target=""_blank"">Devon Sproule MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",3177,$15 ,,7/20/09 0:00Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players,Lady Blanche,,0,,"<p>Lady Blanche is a quirky Brooklyn based singer, songwriter, and wannabe shredder.

While their 2006 self-titled Fueled By Ramen debut introduced the world to the band's inventive brand of indie rock, with their latest album they've proved how versatile they've become from spending the past two years on the road and refining their craft-and they can't wait to finally show the rest of the world the fruits of their hard-earned labor.</p><p>Originally formed in the suburbs of Seattle in 2003 by Australian-born vocalist Daniel Young and guitarist Gavin Phillips, the band's current lineup also features bassist David Blaise and drummer Andy Horst and is their strongest to date. ""It's like a family, it's really awesome,"" Young says about the band's current status. ""We finally feel like a real band."" In fact these four musicians are probably closer than the average nuclear family when you consider the fact that they spent the last year together holed up in the Pacific Northwest in order to write the songs that would appear on Who Are You Now? ""We took a long time off the road before going into the studio because we wanted to write songs that were dripping with creativity and you can't rush that,"" Young explains, ""I think the end result is much stronger because of that.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thisprovidence"" target=""_blank"">This Providence MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",2797,$15 ,,7/11/09 23:00The Click Five + Kevin Hearn & Thin Buckle,,,2615,,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Best known as a skilled multi-instrumentalist in platinum-selling international pop heroes Barenaked Ladies, Hearn has long pursued a parallel solo career path. As a solo artist, Kevin Hearn has operated underneath the commercial radar, but has earned a loyal international following with his highly idiosyncratic yet tuneful sound.</p><p>Recently Kevin has toured as a member of Lou Reed's band. He has also toured as pianist/vocalist with Laurie Anderson. He has appeared as a musical guest on a number of recordings including the latest offerings from  Broken Social Scene, The Tragically Hip, Ron Sexsmith and Garth Hudson.</p><p>Havana Winter is the follow-up to the much-lauded release The Miracle Mile, which has been deftly described as ""The Flaming Lips school of existential-crisis management, both in the celestial synth/symphonic arrangements and in the curious examination of the precarious balance between science and faith"" (Eye Weekly). With The Miracle Mile, Kevin Hearn found critical acclaim and emotional pathos with his exploration of personal struggle with leukemia and its treatment. <br /> <br />The musical empathy within Thinbuckle (Hearn, bassist Chris Gartner and drummer Bob Scott first played together back in the late '80s, in offbeat rock band Look People) is clearly audible. So too is Hearn's longtime creative collaboration with co-producer Michael Phllip Wojewoda, who has worked extensively with Barenaked Ladies and produced both Kevin's solo debut, Mothball Mint, and H-Wing. <br /> <br />Havana Winter will keep you cool, cool, cool in the shade.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/kevinhearnthinbuckle"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Hearn &amp; Thinbuckle MySpace</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em></em></p><p><em></em></p>",2616,$15 advance/ $18 at the door,,7/11/09 2:30Private Event,,,0,,,2079,,,7/10/09 23:00Viking's Bday Bash w/ Viking (original set),The Grenade + Young Enough + Static Brigade,CJ Milli (DJ set),0,TerrorDactel,"<p><strong>LATE SHOW!</strong></p><p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>Come celebrate Viking's Bday with DC's finest electro bands and solo artists.

Much of that is because of the relationship the group has with its fans. It usually starts in small clubs or even backyards in their hometown, then spreads to nearby cities, neighboring states and soon across entire regions, until the band finally comes into its own as a national presence.</p><p>The Benjy Davis Project is poised to take on that presence. They've spent the past seven years building fan strongholds around the U.S., releasing three albums that capture their unique force. Davis's songs speak to the ability of music to move an audience, as seen in countless nights of touring and performing. There comes a point in a breakthrough band's career where they finally turn that corner into greatness. With the release November 4th on Rock Ridge Music of the Benjy Davis Project's album, ""Dust,"" this Baton Rouge, Louisiana-based band now moves into that moment.</p><p>""I want to reach people and hopefully touch them in some way."" That's how Benjy Davis describes his mission, and music is his medium. It's always been that way for him, since he was a young teenager in Louisiana, listening to everything on the radio, taking it all in until it would be his time to step up and become an artist. He formed the Benjy Davis Project in 2001, which began as a simple folk-rock duo but soon grew into one of the most popular bands in Baton Rouge. Eventually expanding into a six-piece group, the Project has recorded three albums prior to ""Dust,"" each a big leap from the one before, and played across the country as headliners and support act on shows with John Mayer, Better Than Ezra, North Mississippi All-Stars and others, as well as events like the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival. All this experience has brought them to that place where they can become the next band to take their Southern-based sound to a new level of national popularity.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/benjydavisprojectla"" target=""_blank"">Benjy Davis Project MySpace</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.rockridgefree.com"" target=""_blank"">*Download a free Benjy Davis Project track here!*</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",2968,$12 ,,7/6/09 13:00ALL TIME LOW MYSPACE SECRET CD RELEASE SHOW,,,0,,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><p><strong>Doors open at 9pm (Monday night) and tickets will be given to the first 200 people in line at that point.

For the last two  years, The Pocket has been touring the US and the Caribbean. They have performed mainstage at the Air Jamaica Jazz and Blues Festival with icons Roberta Flack, Third World and Nora Jones. The Pocket also had the honor of showcasing  at The Bob Marley 60th Anniversary Festival presented by Tuff Gong.

Hailing from Miami, a city whose whole appeal is wealth and exclusivity, the band may seem like a crew of outsiders with their grassroots desire for nothing more than a good time.  The group relishes in their role as a pillar of the Miami independent music scene, by doing exactly the opposite of what is expected.  They have cemented their image of a stranger in a strange place, literally and figuratively by adopting a polar bear as mascot.  The polar bear does not belong in Miami and in many ways neither does the combination of sounds that comes from Jordan Davidson, Jason Haft, Curtis Nystrom, Jeffrey James and Geneva Harrison.</p><p>The JeanMarie's music is the sound of multi-tasking. Drawing on influences ranging from Steve Reich to Prince, they create an un-categorizeable cacophony that can only be referred to as ""grungy guitar, squiggle synth, simmering cymbal-and-bass drum boogie music.""</p><p>The JeanMarie released their first EP, What's a Revolution Without Backup Dancers?, to critical acclaim in 2006, and the self titled follow up EP in 2007. In January 2009 they will release Annie Jump Cannon, their highly anticipated full length album which has already brought them attention across the blogosphere and an article in the New York Times.</p><p>Chosen to open for national touring bands such as Bloc Party, The Noisettes, HelloGoodbye, and Tokyo Police Club, The JeanMarie aims to please. Unpretentious rock has never sounded so good.  Join the revolution against the obvious, boring and fake but make sure you wear comfortable shoes, at The JeanMarie's party you'll be shaking it all night.</p><p><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thejeanmarie"" target=""_blank"">The JeanMarie MySpace</a></p><p><em><br /></em></p>",2795,$12 ,,6/27/09 22:00Local Matinee with Bloodlines + Kid Architect,,,2823,,"<p><em>This show will be standing room only - with very limited seating.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kid Architect was formed in late 2008 in Northern Virginia from the remnants of dismantled local bands whose members desperately sought to find a musical home full of musicians as dedicated and inspired as themselves. What resulted was the formation of an experimental rock band named Kid Architect with members Thomas Bridgwood (piano, guitars, and vocals), Tommy Alter (drums and percussion), Mike Douaire (lead guitar), and Clint Petty (bass). While the members of Kid Architect remain friendly, playful, and often goofy at heart, their music exhibits a sonic maturity and structure well beyond the short time they have existed.</p><p>For lack of a better term, the members of Kid Architect call their music a unique brand of experimental rock. Ranging from heavily distorted rock songs to the delicate intricacies of classical guitar licks, the members of Kid Architect are fluent in a diverse array of musical stylings.</p><p>This show will serve as Kid Architect's CD release Party for their newly recorded ""PhilosoRaptor"" EP.
