The record first began to take shape at Chase Park  Transduction Studios, where a series of songs were recorded between  friends, songs that were initially never intended to be released.  Intrigued by the results of these sessions, songwriter and vocalist  Carmen Cirignano decided to continue working on them with longtime  producer and engineer Steve Poponi at the Gradwell House in Haddon  Heights, NJ. It was here, with the help of bassist Tom Ryan and drummer  Daniel Bogan, that these songs were transformed into the impressive  debut record for a band comprised of longtime friends in the  Philadelphia area music scene. Full of swelling guitars, intricate vocal  melodies and introspective lyrics, ""Young Statues"" is evidence of a  group of musicians who have honed their skills and made a record to be  revered for its beauty, tact, and honesty.<br /><span style=""color: #c0c0c0;""><a href=""http://youngstatues.tumblr.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/youngstatues"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/youngstatues"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fyoung-statues%252Fid478887808%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/youngstatues"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p>",http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2198,$10 advance/$13 day of,"5:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens6:30 - Doors7:30 - The Dangerous Summer","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 5:30<br/>• General admission standing<br/>• First come, first seated"Dan Bern,dan-bern,12/16/12 23:00,,http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2187,$18 ,"5pm - The new Lobby Bar opens6pm - Doors7pm - Dan Bern","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 5pm<br/>• General admission seated<br/>• First come, first seated"Since Antarctica,since-antarctica,12/15/12 2:00,"<p><br /><strong>DAUGHTER OF STARS</strong><br />Daughter of Stars' style echoes that of decades past where rock 'n roll was devoid of pretention and full of hopeful innocence. Thundering riffs are tempered with heartfelt songwriting and soaring harmonies fusing each song with a searing intensity. The band burst onto the DC scene in late 2011 when Billboard Award winning songwriter Nick Samuels, formerly of Numa, found an outlet for the raw rock sound he was envisioning in vocalist Devon, whose powerful bluesy wail has been compared to 70's rockers Ann Wilson and Janis Joplin. The quartet was rounded out by former One Third Dork drummer Jon Varga and bassist David Scherzinger who layed down the solid groove needed for the songs to take flight. Be sure to catch their next show and fall under the spell of the Daughter of Stars.<br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.reverbnation.com/daughterofstars"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/daughterofstars"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> </span></p><p><strong>THE AUTOMATICS</strong><br />From Northern Virginia to a stage near you: Danny Oelkers, Alex Blough, Erik Schumacher, and Jill Miller are defining their lives with juicy tunes they can smile about.

A warm familiar pulse of love and loss echoing from somewhere just under the surface. Written with unguarded lyrical honesty, Erick's songs are passionate confessions that reflect many of our own deeply rooted emotions and secrets. Since releasing his debut EP, It's Getting Too Late To Say It's Early, in 2008, Erick's powerful voice and deeply personal songwriting style have led listeners through music rich with themes central to the emotional cornerstones of their lives. And recently, the message of Erick's music has quickly started to spread. Astonishingly, it wasn't until after college graduation that Erick, a small town Tennessee native, first picked up a guitar. In the smoky corners of Knoxville's pub and bar scene, Erick taught himself to play and sing. His talent became quickly evident, and he soon found himself opening for John Legend. Since, Erick has been invited to perform with an impressive array artists, including James Blunt, Gavin Degraw, Edwin McCain, the Goo Goo Dolls, Grace Potter, Brandi Carlisle and Heart. There is an underlying heartbeat in the songs of Erick Baker, and it is quickly growing stronger. Listen closely....can you feel it? <br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.erickbaker.com/index.php"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/ErickBaker"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/erickbakermusic"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Ferick-baker%252Fid280680835%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/ErickBakerMusic"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p>",http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2162,$18 ,"5:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens6:30 - Doors7:30 - Will Hoge","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 5:30<br/>• General admission seated<br/>• First come, first seated"Tyler Ward,tyler-ward,12/9/12 23:00,,http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2075,$12 adv / $15 day of,"5pm - The new Lobby Bar opens6pm - Doors7pm - Tyler Ward","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 5pm<br/>• General admission standing<br/>• First come, first seated"Fistful of Fifties + Overdrive Superthruster,december-8-late-show,12/9/12 2:00,,http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2199,$10 advance/$13 day of,"9pm - The new Lobby Bar opens10pm - Doors10pm - Fistful of Fifties + Overdrive Superthruster","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 9pm<br/>• General admission standing<br/>• First come, first seated"An Intimate Acoustic Evening w/ Tyrone Wells,tyrone-wells,12/6/12 0:00,,http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2175,$25 ,"6pm - The new Lobby Bar opens7pm - Doors8pm - Tyrone Wells","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 6pm<br/>• General admission seated<br/>• First come, first seated"Jessica Lea Mayfield & David Mayfield: The Sibling Rivalry Tour,jessica-lea-mayfield-david-mayfield,12/5/12 0:00,,http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2189,$15 ,"6pm - The new Lobby Bar opens7pm - Doors8pm - Jessica Lea Mayfield & David Mayfield: The Sibling Rivalry Tour","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 6pm<br/>• General admission standing<br/>• First come, first seated"The Souljazz Orchestra,the-souljazz-orchestra,12/2/12 2:00,"<p><strong>8 OHMS</strong><br />The 8 Ohms are a Horn Heavy Funk and Soul collective from Annapolis, MD.

Her music style is difficult to label but generally falls into the Pop-Rock genre.

She has been compared to artists Kate Bush, Fiona Apple, Bruce Hornsby, Amy Winehouse, and Adele. Piano has a natural talent for writing, recording, and producing her own music, but interacting with live audiences is where she really comes alive. Her latest single ""True Story"" is now available via online vendors including iTunes.""Another young talent, a local, Northern Virginia native who goes by the name THEYCALLMEPIANO, opened the show [Nat and Alex Wolff at Jammin' Java] and quickly showed that she, too, has showmanship beyond her years. At just 14, the girl whose nickname became part of her stage name commanded a Roland X-7 keyboard with well-earned confidence, running through a set of songs that alternated between diverse covers - Korn, Radiohead, Katy Perry (again!), La Roux - and her own original tunes, all of them driven by driving dance beats, sharp riffs and strong vocals. One particular tune, ""Exit,"" was so well-received that one wondered if it was an obscure hit, but it turned out to be one of TCMP's originals, yet another sign that this 14-year-old girl has potential to spare."" - Examiner.com<br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.theycallmepiano.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/Theycallmepiano"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Theycallmepiano/301402276569929"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Ftheycallmepiano%252Fid551806320%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/theycallmepiano"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p><p><strong>AMANDA LEE</strong><br />Born in Towson, MD and raised in the tri-state area of DC, VA, MD, Amanda Lee has minimal experience beyond the east coast realm of life. Her aching and yearning for more is apparent in her music and may just be the drive that takes her to far places.Though one may hear some pop and folk sensibilities, the ""pop"" or ""folk"" category do not quite pinpoint Lee's sound. Her dynamic voice can calm you like lullaby and then surprise you when she lifts into a high soar. In her live performances, she incorporates the looper pedal to layer sweet, haunting vocal harmonies. Her lyrics are simple yet rich with meaning. Whatever genre it is, Lee's sound is soothingly addictive.With the ambition of wanting to put her music in people's hands, Lee partnered with Pledge Music in late 2010 to campaign the funding of her first EP. With much success, her fans prevailed and thus Lee was able to start recording with Kevin Gutierrez at Assembly Line Studios in Vienna, VA. Lee co-produced the album with Gutierrez and her bass player, Posido Vega. The album was released digitally in April 2011.<br /><a href=""http://www.amandaleemusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/amandaleemusic"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/TheAmandaLeeMusic"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Famanda-lee%252Fid216585281%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/amandaleemusic"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></p><p><strong>SARA DAVENPORT</strong><br />Like an Edward Hopper canvas, Sara Davenport's songs speak of loneliness and separation, but her voice delivers the promise of a brighter day.

Having begun at age 11 with classical and flamenco lessons and  gradually applying his teachings to the electric and steel string  acoustic guitar, Bruno's unique stylings truly have a sound all their  own. After stints as a lead guitarist and songwriter for many acclaimed  bands (most notably Crowded Streets, a Dave Matthews Band Tribute),  Bruno decided it was time to give his fans a bigger taste of his  personal musical journey, and thus, Last Second Left was born. Last  Second Left's repertoire has been influenced by such notable musicians  as Carlos Santana, Baden Powell, Tim Mahoney and Mike Einziger, but it  also goes beyond that to truly display Bruno's growth as both a  songwriter and guitarist. With guest vocalist Lindsay Hough of The  Fishermen and a plethora of other talented backing musicians  accompanying Bruno, the final sound demonstrated throughout his  self-titled debut album is one of richness and depth. Last Second Left's  live shows will also be sure to please, as Bruno is determined to take  his fans along with him on his musical voyage, sharing with audiences  the energy and passion with which he lives his life - both on stage and  off.<br /><a href=""http://lastsecondleft.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a></p>",http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2183,$10 advance/$13 day of,"9pm - The new Lobby Bar Opens10pm - BLUEfiveoneAfter The Show - Lobby Bar stays open!","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 9pm<br/>• General admission standing<br/>• First come, first seated"Lucy Wainwright Roche + Lindsay Fuller,lucy-wainwright-roche-lindsay-fuller,11/17/12 23:00,,http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2126,$12 ,"5pm - The new Lobby Bar opens6pm - Doors7pm - Lucy Wainwright Roche + Lindsay Fuller ","• Full dinner and drink menu available <br/>• All ages <br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 5pm <br/>• General admission seated<br/>• First come, first seated"In The Lobby Bar: Irresponsible + Guests,in-the-lobby-bar-w-irresponsible,11/17/12 2:00,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Firresponsible%252Fid315759412%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank""></a></span></p>",,FREE!,"9:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens10:30 - In The Lobby Bar: Irresponsible + Guests","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 9:30pm<br/>• First come, first seated "An Evening with Ellis Paul,ellis-paul,11/16/12 23:30,,http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=1917,$20 ," 5:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens6:30 - Doors7:30 - Ellis Paul","• Full dinner and drink menu available <br/>• All ages <br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 6:30pm <br/>• General admission seating<br/>• First come, first seated"Matt Wertz (at The Hamilton),matt-wertz-at-the-hamilton,11/15/12 23:30,,http://www.eventfarm.com/tokens/event/4fe27901-0850-4eba-b99b-3fa10ab551d8,$25 ,,"This show will take place atThe Hamilton in Washington, DC "TRUTH & SALVAGE CO + TIM BRANTLEY: The Music 4 Vets Tour,truth-salvage-co-tim-brantley-the-music-4-vets-tour,11/15/12 23:30,"<p><strong>TIM BRANTLEY</strong><br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.timbrantley.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""https://en.twitter.com/TimBrantley"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/TimBrantleyMusicPage?ref=ts"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Ftim-brantley%252Fid34623010%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPUOtT10QjQ"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p><p><strong>JESSE THOMAS</strong><br />Jesse wrapped up her debut ""Hazel EP"" in the spring of 2010 for release in September.

Ian Axel) + Hannah Georgas + Nathan Angelo,ian-axel-hannah-georgas-nathan-angelo,11/13/12 0:00,"<p><strong>NATHAN ANGELO</strong><br />What happens when you take soulful keys and pair them with perceptive storytelling, rock-infused melodies, and heartbreaking hooks?You get Nathan Angelo.And, more recently, you get his latest release, Follow Your Heart.An Atlanta transplant and minister's son, Nathan discovered music at an early age where he spent much of his youth as his church's Director of Music, developing his vocals and finding a home on the keys. With no plans of pursuing music professionally, Nathan stumbled into songwriting more as catharsis than ambition. What started as a hobby after college quickly turned into a passion, one which he soon felt necessary to share with an audience. His first two projects Through Playing Me (2006) and These 'Ol Keys (2009) reveal a soulful disposition and a natural affinity for provocative songwriting.Coupled with an incessant touring schedule and attention paid to the ever-changing landscape of social media, Nathan has managed to sell over 15,000 albums independently. He's also toured with national acts such as the Fray, Zac Brown Band, Marc Broussard and Matt Wertz. In 2009, Nathan caught the attention of a major publishing company, Warner/Chappell. Compelled by his ability to mix modern-pop with classic songwriting, Warner/Chappell signed Nathan to a publishing deal, a rare occasion for an independent artist, and has since been called upon to write for the likes of Kelly Clarkson &amp; Justin Bieber.A commercial spin on soul-infused pop, Nathan's latest project Follow Your Heart (2011) emerges as his strongest work to date. Laced with both whimsy and candor, songs like ""Love Is On the Line,"" ""Make Up Your Mind,"" ""Forgetting You"" and ""Hurt Me"" treat the intricacies and frustrations of youth and relationships with due weight yet have a playfulness that lightens the situation. In reference to Follow Your Heart, Nathan calls it ""a very personal project yet one that I believe to be universal in its ability to relate to what we all go through.""As much an album title as it is an anthem, Follow Your Heart displays Nathan's ear for melody and keen understanding of story and reveals that he has much in store for fans both new and old.<br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.nathanangelo.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/nathanangelo"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/nathanangelo"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fnathan-angelo%252Fid260839446%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/angeloandthemob/"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p>",http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2186,$12 ,"6pm - The new Lobby Bar opens7pm - Doors8pm - Ian Axel + Hannah Georgas + Nathan Angelo","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 6pm<br/>• General admission standing<br/>• First come, first seated"Alex Goot,alex-goot,11/11/12 23:00,,http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2178,$15 ,"5pm - The new Lobby Bar opens6pm - Doors7pm - Alex Goot","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 5pm<br/>• General admission standing<br/>• First come, first seated"Cold Specks,cold-specks,11/11/12 2:00,,http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2180,$10 advance/$13 day of,"9pm - The new Lobby Bar opens10pm - Doors10pm - Cold Specks","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 9pm<br/>• General admission seated<br/>• First come, first seated"Charlie Hunter Duo,charlie-hunter-duo,11/10/12 23:00,,http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2015,$15 advance/$20 day of,"5pm - The new Lobby bar opens6pm - Doors7pm - Charlie Hunter Duo","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 5pm<br/>• General admission seated<br/>• First come, first seated""From The Jayhawks, An  Evening with Gary Louris",gary-louris,11/10/12 0:00,"<p><strong>THE PINES</strong><br />Rising out of the prairies of the Midwest, The Pines are one of the most distinct and powerful indie-rock/Americana groups to hit the national scene in years. Emerging from the same Minneapolis music world that spawned such notable acts as The Jayhawks, The Replacements and Bob Dylan, The Pines have gathered a stunning line-up of musical talent, in both their live shows and on record, that has gained them a faithful and growing following.  Frontmen Benson Ramsey and David Huckfelt share a common musical language rooted in the songs and songwriters of their native Iowa, while each bringing a distinct voice and sensibility to the sound that Rolling Stone senior writer David Fricke called ""quietly gripping"" stark-country. The mysterious sound of The Pines fuses Benson's ethereal, otherworldly, heart-piercing songs with David's earthy, darkly romantic and rough-hewn visionary tales. With masterful guitar work, beautiful vocals and the graceful keyboard and vocal additions of Benson's brother Alex Ramsey, the core of The Pines' sound captivates and elevates with rare intimacy.</p><p>Creating quite a buzz around the Twin Cities and across the Upper Midwest, The Pines caught the attention of acclaimed indie label Red House Records and signed with them in 2007, releasing their breakout album Sparrows in the Bell, named one of the top roots releases of the year by Q Magazine. The Pines wowed audiences at the 2008 South By Southwest (SXSW) and were named one of the musical highlights by CMT.com. They followed up this success with Tremolo, an album that garnered rave reviews in magazines like Rolling Stone and got airplay on tastemaker stations such as KCRW and The Current. It landed them coveted performances on Daytrotter.com and Bob Harris' popular BBC show, winning them new fans across North America and Europe. A great live act whether performing as a stripped-down trio (David Huckfelt, Benson Ramsey and Alex Ramsey) or as a full rock band, The Pines' devoted cult following and has led them to share the stage with such diverse acts as Bon Iver, Mavis Staples, The Arcade Fire, Iris DeMent, Mason Jennings and Spider John Koerner. The Pines just finished a North American tour with Mason Jennings in twenty-five cities, opening for him and playing in his band.<br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.thepinesmusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/thepinesmusic"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/thepinesmusic?ref=ts"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fthe-pines%252Fid27051547%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=xcRAEkILZVA"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p>",http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2146,$20 advance/$25 day of,"6pm - The new Lobby Bar opens7pm - Doors8pm - From The Jayhawks, An  Evening with Gary Louris","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 6pm<br/>• General admission seated<br/>• First come, first seated"An Evening with Unknown Hinson,unknown-hinson,11/9/12 0:00,,http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2130,$20 advance/$25 day of,"6pm - The new Lobby Bar opens7pm - Doors8pm - Unknown Hinson","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 6pm<br/>• General admission standing<br/>• First come, first seated"Griffin House,griffin-house,11/8/12 0:00,"<p><strong>CALLAGHAN</strong><br />Born  in Boston, Lincolnshire to a musical  family, Callaghan was classically  trained on flute from age 6, then  gravitated toward singing and playing  piano. By 14 she was writing  songs, and started trekking to London to  record with various producers.  At 18 Callaghan relocated to London  permanently to live with her  sister (whose flat was so tiny, the singer  slept under the kitchen  table), while recording a number of independent  EPs and playing all  over the city, at spots like the Bedford, Regal  Room, Royal National  Theatre, and 100 Club. A long-time Mullins fan,  Callaghan contacted him  in 2009 through MySpace while seeking a  producer, and he agreed to a  rare collaboration. An initial recording  trip to Atlanta yielded three  songs, prompting her life-changing  relocation there in 2010 to finish  the full-length. Since landing  stateside, Callaghan has toured  extensively throughout the U.S.,  especially alongside Mullins, and  regularly sells out shows in her new  home town of Atlanta. Now that  Life In Full Colour is ready for its full  release, further touring is  planned in support. This year promises to  pick up right where 2011 left  off, but where the singer's compelling  story goes from here is all  part of the adventure. For now, Callaghan  will focus on sharing her  latest creation with listeners, wherever they  may be.<br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.callaghansongs.com/home.cfm"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/callaghanmusic"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/callaghanmusic"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fcallaghan%252Fid201636659%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/callaghansongs"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p>",http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2058,$15 advance/$18 day of,"6pm - The new Lobby Bar opens7pm - Doors8pm - Griffin House","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 6pm<br/>• General admission seated<br/>• First come, first seated"Jammin' Java's FREE Election Night Party!,jammin-javas-free-election-night-party,11/6/12 22:00,,,FREE!,,"• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 5pm<br/>• First come, first seated "The Rocket Summer + The Classic Crime + William Beckett (at The Fillmore),the-rocket-summer,11/6/12 0:00,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>THE CLASSIC CRIME</strong><br />Seattle based alt-rockers The Classic  Crime are gearing up to drop their new album, Phoenix, on August 14, and  as a precursor they're offering up the ultimate in behind-the-scenes  access - a series of free podcasts detailing the full album.

I packed up my dad's 'burb  buggy with 2 guitars, a barstool and a tub of t-shirts and CDs and set  off for the east coast. I played any and every show that would have me.  drove through blizzards and listened to way too much John Mayer and  Bright Eyes. I fell in love. I came home and started a band called The  Academy Is... I wrote a record about following my dreams and breaking  out for good. We did, and I never slowed down. 7 years, 3 albums, over a  half a million records sold on top of countless shows played for  thousands and thousands of people around the world including a dozen  tours in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand,  Singapore, UK, Germany, Belgium, and Chile, my band went as far and as  fast as any of us dreamt. We performed on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan O'Brien,  and Carson Daly. Over time, lives and minds changed, and something was  missing. I was in a band veiled in secrecy and politics. I broke it up  and started over. I spent the past year and a half writing constantly,  churning out the best work of my career. ""These are hit songs. It's your  turn. You are a superstar,"" I was told. Just after the New Year, I was  inexplicably let go from the label. I took my all of my songs and my  vision and hit the ground running. I surrounded myself with a whole new  team. It's time to walk the talk.  It's all about good, honest music,  and lots of it. It's all about fearlessness and new ideas. It's all  about playing shows for the best fans in the world and making new ones.  It's all about being true to who I am and what I stand for, especially  when I don't seem to ""fit in."" I'm not interested in being anyone other  than myself. The next chapter started with the debut solo EP release  ""Walk the Talk,"" followed by much more music to come as 2012 unfolds.""<br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://williambeckettmusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/williambeckett"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/williambeckettmusic"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fwilliam-beckett%252Fid260172227%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvxHdGIvLRU&amp;feature=related"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p>",http://www.livenation.com/event/15004932DD196AC8,$15 ,,"This show will take place atThe Filmore in Silver Spring, MD<br/>• All ages <br/>• General admission standing"The Milk Carton Kids,milk-carton-kids,11/5/12 23:30,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LESLIE STEVENS</strong><br />""Leslie &amp; the Badgers are quietly turning into one of the city's best...what makes the songs magical is the way Stevens spruces up the retro country-pop settings with clear-eyed and thoughtfully incisive lyrics."" - LA Weekly<br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/LeslieStevensMusic"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fleslie-and-the-badgers%252Fid277454739%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | Y<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/lesliestevenstv"" target=""_blank"">outube</a></span></p>",http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2108,$15 ,"5:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens6:30 - Doors7:30 - The Milk Carton Kids","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 5:30pm<br/>• General admission seated<br/>• First come, first seated"Trixie Whitley,trixie-whitley,11/4/12 23:30,,http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2174,$10 advance/$13 day of,"5:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens6:30 - Doors7:30 - Trixie Whitley","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 5:30pm<br/>• General admission standing<br/>• First come, first seated"Acoustic Lunch w/Multi-Wammie Award Winners: Dead Men's Hollow + Cletus & Lori,dead-mens-hollow,11/4/12 17:00,"<p><strong>CLETUS &amp; LORI</strong><br />Award-winning singer-songwriters on their own, Cletus Kennelly &amp; Lori Kelley combined their artistries, developing a style and a sense for each other's voices that is magical.

Not that such anxiety is evident on the highly accomplished disc, the follow-up to Ruben's self-released 2008 debut, Aiming for Honesty. Adding full-band accompaniment to his lush, soulful pop-rock, Ruben also stretches impressively as a writer on The Ones That Matter, achieving a near-novelistic sense of character and setting on finely hewn tracks like ""A Lack of Armor,"" ""Bleeker and Sixth,"" and ""Unbreakable."" His relentless attention to detail pays off handsomely. Ruben's expansive and deeply compassionate point of view has resonated strongly with an ever-growing audience, whom the performer has cultivated with virtually nonstop touring and persistent online networking; as a result, he's sold some 5,000 copies of Honesty on his own. The artist cites singer-songwriters like Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell and James Taylor as his greatest influences, but also admits a fondness for the standards penned by Cole Porter and the Gershwins. As a live performer he racked up odd experiences like playing backyard barbecues, singing at a daytime Sweet 16 party, and even serenading a couple of fans on their anniversary (he showed up in their kitchen with his guitar, at the woman's bidding, to surprise her boyfriend). The gigs gradually got bigger, and soon Ruben was paying his rent with engagements across the East Coast - becoming adept at getting around by commuter rail, booking cheap flights, promoting his shows and maintaining contact with fans via Facebook, his blog and the comments on his YouTube video posts.But for the time being, Ruben's true home is the road - where he'll no doubt continue to touch lives, have offbeat adventures and add new names to the ever-growing list of The Ones That Matter.<br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.jesseruben.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official Site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/jesseruben/"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/jesseruben"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/jesse-ruben/id269249439?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">iTunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/jesserubenmusic/"" target=""_blank"">YouTube </a></span></p><p><strong>JOHNNYSWIM</strong><br />JOHNNYSWIM is a Los Angeles based duo composed of Amanda Sudano and Abner Ramirez. The two began writing and singing together in the spring of 2006 and found that their similar influences of folk, soul, and rock blended together lusciously. Nashville newspaper ""the Tennesean"" describes JOHNNYSWIM as ""A mix of Lauryn Hill and John Mayer"". The inspiration for the name of the duo came from the scene in the classic movie Jaws when a character named Johnny is attempting to flee from the shark as his friend shouts from the pier, ""Swim, Johnny, swim!"". Johnnyswim regularly perform new material for the New Music Mondays installment on their official YouTube Channel.

Drawing on influences from modern artists like Jack Johnson and Jamie Cullum, as well as paying tribute to classic greats Johnny Cash and Frank Sinatra, Kent's perfectly mellifluous tunes are roll-the-windows-down, soak-up-some-sun kind of good. Since the release of his debut album ""Neoteny,"" the singer-songwriter is currently collaborating with his trio, Jamie Kent &amp; The Options, to cultivate a sound with a strong folk and jazz influence. In the past year they have toured extensively across the US, playing over 200 shows throughout 40 states. Additionally, they have received national radio play on over 120 stations, and recently signed licensing agreements with MTV, VH1, Bravo, and The Discovery Network! Reviews of Kent's music have stated that he ""possesses a great voice and a fearlessness to be admired as he drifts through glimpses of blues, jazz, and rock notes that suggest Steely Dan influences without being derivative."" He has been called a troubadour, entrepreneur, and vocal sensation. ""With an authentic voice that often evokes the moaning grooveness of Chicago's Bobby Lamm, he's got tremendous range, a unique playfullness, and a certain fearlessness.

This smashing brand of rock 'n' roll has earned the band rave reviews -- from friends and fans alike. Described by Washington Post Express as ""super-charged power-pop"" with ""the most infectious of driving melodics,"" Club Scout proudly plays a distinct brand of excited rock music. Formed in 2007 in Washington, DC, Club Scout features Ben Eiserike (vocals/guitar), Javier Diaz (guitar), Jeremy Charpentier (bass) and Joe Ostrosky (drums/vocals). Guitarists Ben Eiserike and Javier Diaz became fast friends while working as college interns at a mom-and-pop record label in nearby Silver Spring, Maryland. A shared interest in music and fun brought the two together. With the addition of longtime friend Joe Ostrosky on drums and new friend Jeremy Charpentier on bass, Club Scout was complete. The group's expanding songbook spans from playful to serious, combining thoughtful lyrics with raucous guitars, melodic undertones, and pounding rhythms. Undoubtedly, Club Scout thrives in front of a live audience, bringing rock 'n' roll dynamism to the masses.<br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.clubscoutmusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/clubscout"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> </span></p>",http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2169,$10 advance/$13 day of,"6pm  - The new Lobby Bar opens7pm - Doors8pm - JJAMZ","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 6pm<br/>• General admission standing<br/>• First come, first seated"Rosi Golan + Carina Round,rosi-golan,10/21/12 23:30,,http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2145,$15 ,"5:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens6:30 - Doors7:30 - Rosi Golan","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 5:30<br/>• General admission seated<br/>• First come, first seated"Norman Rockwell CD Release & After-Party,norman-rockwell-,10/21/12 0:00,"<p><strong>THE FAMILY PLOTS</strong><br />The Family Plots is a collection of musicians and writers obsessed with three part harmonies and graveyard melodies.

By the end of 2008 however, with the addition  of drummer, Michael, the band began to concentrate on producing original  lyrics and melodies. After auditioning several singers without luck,  the band finally found Adam. The new dynamics of the group helped to  jumpstart the band's productivity and Sub-Radio Standard was officially  born. Later, Mark Barry Siford joined on bass and Mike Chinen joined on  guitar to smooth up the rhythm section. The band quickly began writing  original songs as well as learning covers.

Banjos, vibes, pedal steel, and ambient vocals make up this bluegrass-trained songwriter's new and vibrant approach to making music, and the end result is somewhere between Iron &amp; Wine and Emmylou Harris.  <br /><a href=""http://luraymusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/luray_who"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Luraymusic"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a></p>",http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2132,$12 ,"6pm - The new Lobby Bar opens7pm - Doors8pm - Jim White","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 6pm<br/>• General admission seated<br/>• First come, first seated"Stroke Comeback Center Benefit w/The Blues Drivers + Marc Black,stroke-comeback-center-benefit-w-the-blue-drivers-marc-black,10/15/12 22:30,,http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2190,$25 ,"4:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens5:30 - Doors6:30 - Stroke Comeback Center Benefit ","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 4:30<br/>• General admission seated<br/>• First come, first seated"Jon McLaughlin,jon-mclaughlin,10/14/12 23:30,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>XENIA</strong><br />Music has always been a part of Xenia's life. As a result, the 16-year-old Southern California native delivers honest and soulful pop songs with palpable vitality. That energy landed her in the Top 8 on NBC's hit television show, The Voice, as the youngest finalist. It's apparent in her recent duet with Jon McLaughlin, ""Maybe It's Over"". She found out about The Voice auditions in Los Angeles on Twitter, merely two weeks after starting an account. Her parents brought her to the audition, and she nailed it. The NBC show became a massive hit, garnering incredible ratings and soon adding a second season. For Xenia, it was a monumental event.

His trademark sugarcane-sweet melodies, pop-soul hooks and rock chords subtly subvert commonly held notions of what Cuban music is. Alex is on the vanguard, crafting a cross-cultural sound that mirrors his geographical journey. Alex is defining his own ""Latin Soul"" genre. He has won two JUNO Awards (2006 and 2008) and a SOCAN Award (2009) in Canada, a Latin Grammy Award (2010) for Best New Artist, a BMI Latin Award and was nominated for a 2011 Grammy Award in the Best Latin Pop Album category. In the digital space, Alex*Cuba has had four iTunes Singles of the Week (Canada, U.S., Japan, Netherlands), has charted on various iTunes charts in Canada, the U.S. and Japan and has independently built an impressive, loyal online community around the world. Alex recently collaborated with Nelly Furtado for her Spanish language debut album ""Mi Plan"" (My Plan) which was released September 2009 around the world (Universal). The creative chemistry between Alex, Nelly and James Bryan was magical and resulted in nine co-writes including the #1 single ""Manos Al Aire"" (Hands in the Air) and the title track where he appears as an invited guest on vocals. A prolific songwriter, Alex is continues working on new collaborations with writers and artists on various projects. In November 2010, Alex was honored with the award for Best New Artist at the 2010 Latin Grammy Awards which took place in Las Vegas. The album ""Alex Cuba"" was also nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Album. Earlier this year, ""Alex Cuba"" was nominated for Best Latin Pop Album at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards and Alex took home a 2011 BMI Latin Award for his songwriting on Nelly Furtado's #1 Spanish hit ""Manos Al Aire"". Critical to Alex' success has been constant touring with a live show that has been described as explosive. Revealing his bass player past, Alex picks, plucks, strums and rocks his Gibson ES355, equipped with the heaviest guage steel strings available, without a pick. <br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.alexcuba.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/alexcuba"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Alex-Cuba/35336990520"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Falex-cuba-band%252Fid82651863%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/123alexcuba"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p><p><strong>TED HOVIS &amp; THE STOLEN CAMAROS</strong><br />Soaring and unrepentant arena rock, deep and dark bass grooves, punctuated with a hint of the blues.

He has some very genuine and organic music that is a fresh take on a tired pop music genre.""</p><p>It all started back on Long Island, where Wax embraced the music of Billy Joel, James Taylor, Dave Matthews Band and other substantive artists from an early age. Taking his time to develop his craft and piano chops, Mikey self-released his debut album ""Change Again"" just 3 years ago. Quoted by bullz-eye magazine as ""uplifting pop/rock and darker, slower-tempo fare"", the album received instant recognition ranking on the iTunes top 100 pop chart in the US, UK, Canada and Australia. Since then, Wax has completed several cross-country tours supporting artists such as Howie Day, Serena Ryder and Landon Pigg. He has also opened for acts such as Andy Grammer, James Durbin, Ryan Cabrera, Tyler Hilton, and Tony Lucca among others. The album features the single ""In Case I Go Again"", which has been placed on popular television shows, including CBS's Ghost Whisperer &amp; MTV's The Real World. In July 2010, the music video for ""In Case I Go Again"" was featured on the YouTube homepage receiving a half-million views. Most recently, the instrumental from this song was featured on NBC during the 2012 Summer Olympics. In the press, the single has been referred to as ""a cool blend of John Mayer meets Coldplay, but clearly still original and catchy!""In April of 2010, Wax released ""The Traveler"" EP for free download on his website mikeywax.com. Integrating social networking to download the EP, ""The Traveler"" received over 10,000 downloads and contributed to Mikey now hosting over 100,000 fans combined via Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and YouTube. In the summer of 2010, Wax completed a headlining house concert tour of 40 homes across the country. This intimate tour left Mikey with hundreds of new fans who connected to his music in a unique and memorable way. ""I knew I was onto something after finishing my very first house show in Boston"", says Wax. ""There's such a special connection made when you play for fans in their own living room. It's up-close and personal."" The success of the 2010 summer tour created even more demand, and resulted in Mikey performing his second annual summer house tour at over 65 homes. While on stage, fans are intrigued by Wax's ability to play both the guitar and piano simultaneously on original songs like ""Last Great Song"" and ""Back and Forth"". Prior to the 2011 summer house tour, Mikey went back to the studio to record his second full-length album with producer Warren Huart (The Fray, Kris Allen, James Blunt). The record, titled ""Constant Motion"", is a dynamic mix that resonates as both a throwback and a fresh, modern sound. The album self-released on September 20th, 2011, and through word-of-mouth, ranked at #6 on the iTunes singer/songwriter chart, and #47 Billboard Heatseekers. The album was supported by a 15-date tour opening for American Idol finalist Elliott Yamin, and features the single ""Counting On You"", which began receiving radio airplay on major adult top-40 stations across the country in December, 2011. ""Counting On You"" continued to build momentum, and on April 9th, 2012, Mikey debuted as only the unsigned artist on the Mediabase adult top-40 (Hot AC) chart. Soon after, Wax was selected by New Music Seminar as an ""artist on the verge"", and supported an east-coast tour with Jon McLaughlin. He was also highlighted by iHeartRadio as an ""Artist To Watch"". On July 25th, ""Counting On You"" was featured on the FOX hit reality television series So You Think You Can Dance. That same night, his song ""You Tell Me When"" was featured on MTV's The Real World. With a distinctive voice, exciting soul-infused pop/rock sound, and passionate live performances, Mikey Wax appears to be on the verge of breakthrough success.<br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""/mikeywax.com"" target=""_blank"">Official site</a> | <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/mikeywax"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/mikeywax"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=*FknwilNy5I&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fartist%252Fmikey-wax%252Fid295368889%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30"" target=""_blank"">Itunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/mikeywaxmusic"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a></span></p>",http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2109,$15 ,"5:30 - The new Lobby Bar opens6:30 - Doors7:30 - Graham Colton","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 5:30pm<br/>• General admission seated<br/>• First come, first seated"The Early November,the-early-november,10/11/12 23:30,"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CARTEL</strong><br />Twenty seconds into ""Let's Go,"" the opening track on CARTEL's third full length CYCLES, singer Will Pugh declares, ""I've got so much left to do but I'll start with this song.""

Dynamic, musically ambitious &amp; bracingly eccentric, with his inimitable style and lush musicality. Hailing from Belfast with a sound that is self-confessed ""hobo-chic"", Duke Special - AKA the endlessly inventive Peter Wilson - is once heard, never forgotten. Blissfully at home in his own alluring genre of beautifully bruised romanticism, Duke Special inhabits a world unlike any other - a world filled with vaudeville-esque sensibility, sing-a-longs and addictive melodies. Those who know him for the platinum album ""Songs from the deep forest"", including the hit song ""Freewheel"" and other radio mainstays like ""Sweet sweet kisses"" and ""Last night I nearly died"" may be surprised by the breadth of his work. Duke Special's immense creative talents have seen him involved in projects as diverse as writing the theme tune for Sesame Tree (the Northern Ireland edition of Sesame Street where he also got to sing with The Muppets) to writing the music for and appearing in Deborah Warner's critically acclaimed 2009 production of Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage and Her Children at London's National Theatre. In 2011, he presented a TV documentary for RTE in Ireland on the life and times of 50s megastar Ruby Murray. This was broadcast in January, and accompanied by 2 orchestral concerts in Dublin and Cork, showcasing Duke's interpretations of Ruby's songs. He also released a charity single of recordings of 3 of Duke's favourite Ruby songs, donating all the profits to the Irish charity Depaul Ireland (www.depaulireland.org). <br /><span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.dukespecial.com/"" target=""_blank"">Official Site</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/dukespecial"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> | <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Duke-Special/13555697973"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/duke-special/id82412390?uo=4&amp;partnerId=30"" target=""_blank"">iTunes</a> | <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/dukespecialofficial"" target=""_blank"">YouTube </a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",http://jamminjava.3dcartstores.com/product.asp?itemid=2099,$20 ,"6pm - The new Lobby Bar opens7pm - Doors8pm - Bell X1","• Full dinner and drink menu available<br/>• All ages<br/>• The Lobby Bar opens at 6pm<br/>• General admission seated<br/>• First come, first seated"The Kin + Find Vienna,the-kin-find-vienna,10/10/12 0:00,"<p><strong>STRUAN SHIELDS</strong><br />Singer/songwriterSinger/songwriter Struan Shields hails from Arlington County, Virginia where he's starting to create quite the stir, sharing stage bills with other upcoming talent in the form of pop-rockers Sing Me Insomnia, fellow singer/songwriter Chase Coy, power-poppers The Hint and Shields' good friends; Indie-rock outfit The Downtown Fiction.
